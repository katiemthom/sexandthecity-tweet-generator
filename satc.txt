Once upon a time, an English journalist came to New York.
Elizabeth was attractive and bright.
Right away she hooked up with one of the city's typically eligible bachelors.
The question remains... Is this really a company we want to own?
Tim was 42, a wellliked and respected investment banker...
who made about two million a year.
They met one evening, in typical New York fashion...
at a gallery opening.
Like it?
Yes, actually. I think it's quite interesting.
What?
I feel like I know you from somewhere.
Doubtful. I only just moved here from London.
London? Really? That's my alltime favorite city.
 It is?  Absolutely.
It was love at first sight.
You know...
I think perhaps I have met you somewhere before.
For two weeks they snuggled...
went to romantic restaurants...
had wonderful sex...
and shared their most intimate secrets.
One warm spring day...
he took her to a town house he saw in Sunday's New York Times.
How 'bout if we start at the top and work our way down?
There are four bedrooms upstairs. Do you have any children?
Not yet.
That day, Tim popped the question.
How'd you like to have dinner with my folks Tuesday night?
I'd love to.
On Tuesday, he called with some bad news.
My mother's not feeling very well.
Well, gosh, I'm sorry.
 Could we take a rain check?  Of course.
Tell your mum I hope she feels better.
When she hadn't heard from him for two weeks, she called.
Tim, it's Elizabeth. That's an awfully long rain check.
He said he was up to his ears and that he'd call her the next day.
He never did call, of course. Bastard.
 She told me one day over coffee.  I don't understand.
In England, looking at houses together would have meant something.
Then I realized no one had told her about the end of love in Manhattan.
Welcome to the age of "uninnocence."
No one has breakfast at Tiffany's, and no one has affairs to remember.
Instead, we have breakfast at 7:00 a. M...
and affairs we try to forget as quickly as possible.
Selfprotection and closing the deal are paramount.
Cupid has flown the coop.
How the hell did we get into this mess?
There are maybe tens of thousands of women like this in the city.
We all know them, and we all agree they're great.
They travel. They pay taxes.
They'll spend $400 on a pair of Manolo Blahnik strappy sandals.
And they're alone.
It's like the riddle of the Sphinx.
Why are there so many great unmarried women...
and no great unmarried men?
I explore these sorts of issues in my column...
and I have terrific sources: My friends.
When you're a young guy in your 20s, women are controlling the relationship.
So by the time you're an eligible man in your 30s...
you feel like you're being devoured by women.
Suddenly, the guys are holding all the chips.
I call it the mid30s power flip.
It's all about age and biology.
I mean, if you want to get married, it's to have kids, right?
Not with someone older than 35, 'cause you have to have kids right away...
and that's about it.
I think these women should just forget about marriage...
and have a good time.
I have a friend who'd always gone out with extremely sexy guys...
and just had a good time.
One day she woke up, and she was 41.
She couldn't get any more dates. She had a complete physical breakdown...
couldn't hold her job and moved back to Wisconsin to live with her mother.
Trust me... this is not a story that makes men feel bad.
Most men are threatened by successful women.
If you want to get these guys, you have to keep your mouth shut...
and play by the rules.
I totally believe that love conquers all.
Sometimes you just have to give it a little space...
and that's exactly what's missing in Manhattan...
the space for romance.
The problem is expectations.
Older women don't want to settle for what's available.
By the time you reach your mid30s you think, "Why should I settle?"
You know?
It's like the older we get, the more we keep selfselecting...
down to a smaller and smaller group.
What women really want is Alec Baldwin.
There's not one woman in New York who hasn't turned down 10 wonderful guys...
because they were too short or too fat or too poor.
I have been out with some of those guys... the short, fat, poor ones.
It makes absolutely no difference.
They are just as selfcentered and unappreciative as the goodIooking ones.
Why don't these women just marry a fat guy?
Why don't they just marry a big, fat tub of lard?
Happy birthday, dear Miranda
Happy birthday to you
Another 30something birthday with a group of unmarried female friends.
We would all have preferred a nice celebratory conference call.
 You were saying?  Look.
If you're a successful single woman in this city, you have two choices:
You can bang your head against the wall and try and find a relationship...
or you can say "screw it," and just go out and have sex like a man.
 You mean with dildos?  No, I mean without feeling.
Samantha was a New York inspiration.
A public relations executive...
she routinely slept with goodIooking guys in their 20s.
Remember that guy I was going out with? Oh, God, what was his name? Drew.
 Drew the sex god.  Right. Afterwards?
I didn't feel a thing. It was like, "Hey, babe, gotta go. Catch ya later."
And I completely forgot about him after that.
But are you sure that isn't just 'cause he didn't call you?
Sweetheart, this is the first time in the history of Manhattan...
that women have had as much money and power as men...
plus the equal luxury of treating men like sex objects.
Yeah, except men in this city fail on both counts.
I mean, they don't want to be in a relationship with you...
but as soon as you only want them for sex, they don't like it.
All of a sudden they can't perform the way they're supposed to.
 That's when you dump them.  Ladies, are we really that cynical?
What about romance?
 Yeah!  Who needs it?
It's like that guy, Jeremiah, the poet.
I mean, the sex was incredible.
But then he wanted to read me his poetry and go out to dinner...
and the whole chat bit, and I'm like, "Let's not even go there."
What are you saying? That you're just going to give up on love?
 That's sick.  No, no, no. Believe me...
the right guy comes along, and you two here, this whole thing...
 right out the window.  That's right!
Listen to me! The right guy is an illusion. Start living your lives.
So you think it's really possible to pull off this whole...
womenhavingsexlikemen thing?
 You're forgetting The Last Seduction.  You're obsessed with that movie.
Okay, Linda Fiorentino fucking that guy up against the chainlink fence.
And never having one of those "Oh, my God, what have I done?" epiphanies.
I hated that movie.
Was it true?
Were women in New York really giving up on love and throttling up on power?
What a tempting thought.
I'm beginning to think the only place one can still find love and romance...
in New York is the gay community.
It's straight love that's become closeted.
Stanford Blatch was one of my closest friends.
He owned a talent agency and, at the moment, was down to a single client.
So, are you telling me...
that you're in love?
How could I possibly sustain a relationship?
You know Derek takes up like, a thousand percent of my time.
Don't you think that's a bit obsessive?
I'm a passionate person. His career is all I care about.
When that's under control, then I can concentrate on my personal life.
Stanford, he's an underwear model.
With a billboard in Times Square.
Oh, my God. Don't turn around.
The loathe of your life is at the bar.
It was Kurt Harrington...
a mistake I made when I was 26...
and 29...
and 31.
Carrie, don't even go there.
What? Do you think I'm a masochist?
 The man is scum.  Good.
Because I don't have the patience to clean up this mess for the fourth time.
Will you relax? I don't have a shred of feeling left.
Thank God.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to visit the ladies' room.
It was true. I no longer felt a thing for Kurt.
After all these years, I finally saw him for what he was:
A selfcentered, withholding creep...
who was still the best sex I ever had in my life.
However, I did have a little experiment in mind.
Wow. What are you doin' here?
Hey, babe.
 God, you look gorgeous.  Thanks.
So, how's life?
Not bad. Can't complain. You?
Oh, you know, just writing the column. The usual.
So, you seeing anyone special?
Not really. You?
Oh, just a couple guys.
 Well, you look good, though.  So do you.
So...
what are you doing later?
I thought you weren't talking to me for the rest of your life.
Who said anything about talking?
What do you say to my place, 3:00?
All right. See ya there.
Are you out of your mind? What the hell do you think you're doing?
Oh, calm down. It's research.
Oh, God. Oh, Kurt.
Kurt was just like I remembered...
better... because this time...
there would be none of that messy emotional attachment.
All righty. My turn.
Oh, sorry. I have to go back to work.
What? Are you kiddin'? You're serious?
Oh, yeah. Completely. But I'll give you a call.
Maybe we can do it again sometime.
Yeah, but...
As I began to get dressed, I realized that I'd done it.
I'd just had sex like a man.
I left feeling powerful, potent and incredibly alive.
I felt like I owned this city.
Nothing and no one could get in my way.
 Number one, he's very handsome.  There ya go.
Number two, he's not wearing a wedding ring.
Number three, he knows I carry textured Trojans with a reservoir tip.
Thanks a lot.
Anytime.
Later that night, Skipper Johnston met me for coffee...
and confessed a shocking intimate secret.
Thank you.
Do you know that it has been, like, a year?
Really?
I don't understand that. You're such a nice guy.
That's the problem. I'm too nice, you know?
I'm a romantic. I just have so much feeling.
Are you sure you're not gay?
No! I'm sensitive...
and I don't objectify women.
You know, most guys, when they meet a girl...
the first thing that they see is...
 You know...  Pussy?
Oh, God! Oh!
I hate that word.
Don't you have any friends that you can hook me up with?
 They're too old for you.  I like older women.
Maybe.
 Maybe my friend Miranda.  When?
Tomorrow night. We're all going downtown to this club, Chaos.
Great.
Don't tell her I'm nice.
Miranda was gonna hate Skipper.
She'd think he was mocking her with his sweet nature...
and decide he was an asshole...
the way she had decided all men were assholes.
 Hello?  Hey, Carrie, it's Charlotte.
 Hey, sweetie.  Hey.
Look, I can't meet you guys for dinner tomorrow night...
because I have an amazing date.
With who?
Capote Duncan. He's supposedly some big shot in the publishing world.
 Do you know him?  Did I know him?
He was one of the city's most notoriously "ungettable" bachelors.
Wait, don't even answer that question because, frankly, I don't care.
And another thing. I'm not buying any of that womenhavingsexlikemen crap.
I didn't tell her about my afternoon of cheap and easy sex and how good it felt.
All right. Fine. Have a good time, and promise to tell me everything.
Well, if you're lucky.
 Bye.  All right. Bye.
Friday night at Chaos.
It was just like that bar in "Cheers" where everybody knows your name...
except here they were likely to forget it five minutes later.
Hi.
Still, it was the creme de la creme of New York whipped into a frenzy.
Sometimes you got a souffle...
sometimes cottage cheese.
It is like a model bomb exploded in this room tonight.
Is there a woman here aside from me who weights more than a hundred pounds?
I know. It's like "Undereaters Anonymous."
That's funny, Skippy.
 Skipper.  I have this theory...
that men secretly hate pretty girls because they rejected them in school.
Right. But if you're not part of the "Beauty Olympics"...
you can still become a very interesting person.
Are you saying that I'm not pretty enough?
No, no, no. Of course you are.
So, ipso facto, I can't be interesting?
Women fall into one of two categories:
Beautiful and boring or homely and interesting, is that it?
No, that's not what I meant.
Excuse me. Is this your hand on my knee?
Let's just keep 'em where I can see 'em, all right?
Well, I guess you must find me beautiful.
 Or interesting.  I was about to rescue Skipper...
from an increasingly hopeless situation, when suddenly...
Lucky me, twice in one week.
Well, I don't know if you're going to be getting that lucky.
You know, I was really pissed off the way you left the other day.
 You were?  Yeah.
Then I thought, how great!
You finally understand the kind of relationship I want...
and now we can have sex without commitment.
Yeah. Right. Sure. I guess.
 So when I feel like it, I'll call you.  Yeah, please.
Whenever you feel like it. If I'm alone, I'm all yours.
Right.
I like this new you.
Call me.
Yup.
I didn't understand.
Did all men secretly want their women promiscuous and emotionally detached?
And if I was really having sex like a man, why didn't I feel more in control?
You see that guy? He's the next Donald Trump...
except he's younger and much better looking.
Hi.
 You know him?  No.
I've never seen him in my life.
He usually dates models, but, hey, I'm as goodIooking as a model...
plus I own my own business.
Samantha had the kind of deluded selfconfidence...
that caused men like Ross Perot to run for president...
and it usually got her what she wanted.
Well, if you're not gonna hit on him, I will.
And there she went...
off to take her best shot with Mr. Big.
Meanwhile, Charlotte York was having a splendid evening with Capote Duncan.
Wanna go back to my place and see the Ross Blechner?
I'd love to, but it's really getting late.
No problem.
 What year was it painted again?  '89.
Though Charlotte was determined to play hardtoget...
she didn't want to end the evening too abruptly.
Well, maybe just for a minute.
This could easily go for a hundred grand.
Ross is so hot right now.
It's beautiful.
No, you're beautiful.
Thank you for tonight.
 Yeah?  I had a wonderful time.
Well, it was my pleasure.
I have to get up really early tomorrow.
I'll get you a cab.
Charlotte told me she thought she had played the entire evening flawlessly.
So, what are you doing next Saturday?
I'm having dinner with you.
 You're going to the West Side, right?  Right. West Fourth and Bank, please.
Hey, scoot over, will ya? Two stops:
Fourth and Bank and...
West Broadway and Broom.
 You're going to Chaos?  Oh. Yeah.
Why?
Look, I understand where you're coming from...
and I totally respect it...
but I really need to have sex tonight.
Back at Chaos...
things were swinging into high gear...
and Samantha was putting the moves on Mr. Big.
I've been smoking cigars for years...
back when they were terminally uncool.
I've got this great source that sends me Hondurans. Do you want to try one?
 No, thank you.  Really? You can't find them anywhere.
Cohibas... that's all I smoke.
Look, I do the PR for this club...
and I have the key to the private room downstairs.
Really?
You want a private tour?
No, thanks, but maybe another time.
Meanwhile...
Skipper Johnston was hopelessly smitten with Miranda Hobbes.
 So, where we goin' now?  Listen, Skippy...
you know, you really are a nice, sweet guy, but...
Oh, I understand.
Good night.
Miranda told me later that she thought he was too nice...
but that she was willing to overlook one flaw...
and Capote Duncan found his fix for the night.
Where is it? I wanna see the Ross Blechner.
Wait. Later.
Later.
Oh, listen, l...
I gotta get up really early...
and, actually, you can't stay over.
Cool?
Sure. I have to get up really early too.
Taxi! Taxi!
And so another Friday night in Manhattan crept towards dawn.
Just when I thought I would have to do the unspeakable...
walk home...
Well, get in, for Christ's sakes.
 Where can I drop you?  72nd Street and Third Avenue.
 Have you got that, Al?  Yes, sir.
So, what have you been doing lately?
You mean besides going out every night?
Yeah. I mean, what do you do for work?
Well, this is my work.
I'm sort of a sexual anthropologist.
You mean like a hooker?
I write a column called "Sex and the City."
Right now I'm researching an article about women who have sex like men.
You know, they have sex...
and then afterwards they feel nothing.
 But you're not like that.  Well, aren't you?
Not a drop. Not even half a drop.
Wow. What's wrong with you?
I get it.
You've never been in love.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Suddenly I felt the wind knocked out of me.
I wanted to crawl under the covers and go right to sleep.
 Thanks for the ride.  Anytime.
Wait.
Have you ever been in love?
Absofuckin'lutely.
When you live on a tiny island like Manhattan...
...the odds of bumping into the one who broke your heart are incredibly high.
The odds of bumping into him when you look like shit are even higher.
After a breakup, certain streets, locations...
...even times of day are offlimits.
The city becomes a deserted battlefield loaded with emotional land mines.
You have to be very careful where you step or you could be blown to pieces.
Get your coat, Anne Frank, we're going out.
I'm really not in the mood. Coat on. Body out.
Where are we going? It's a surprise.
Only if it's nowhere I can run into him.
When do you think you're gonna be getting out of this hostage situation?
Am I wrong?
Don't Iisten to her, it's only been a month.
It takes half the total time you went out with someone to get over them.
I always Iike a math solution to any Iove problem.
It's the breakup rule. You and Big only went out for a year.
She's got five more months to get over him.
Cut your Iosses and get back in the game.
When Eric and I broke up, I got over him right away.
I don't really remember it being Iike that.
Eric who?
Eric, asshole I dated a couple of years ago.
That Eric.
Miranda called Eric the love of her life until he left her for another woman.
Now, she almost never mentioned him.
You can't push yourself into feeling good.
The only way to get over somebody is to feel really bad, cry to your girlfriends...
...and to replay what you hated about him over and over in your head all day.
That sounds about right.
You're too dressed up for where we're going.
I'II risk being overdressed vs. the chance of meeting Big Iooking the way I feel.
The first meeting is the worst, you never know how to act.
Then there's the vomiting.
If Big had any class, he would've moved away. I was here first.
You're giving him too much power. You broke up with him.
Right, and that makes me what, happy?
Taxi!
Amazingly, Samantha was still with James. A monogamous relationship...
...for a woman whose bedroom was busier than Balducci's on a Saturday.
You Iovebirds....
How are the most beautiful women in Manhattan?
If we see them, I'II ask.
Have a fun day.
Don't Iet anything bad happen to my princess.
I Iove you.
God, everything is going so great.
Me, James, and his tiny penis: We're one big happy family.
After two months, despite all his sweetness and charm...
...Samantha still hadn't quite accepted James's shortcomings.
When Miranda said, "Get back in the game," she meant it.
Forty minutes and a $55 cab ride later, we found ourselves at Yankee Stadium.
Who wants another?
Miranda was a fan of the Yankees.
I was a fan of being able to smoke and drink at 2:00 p.m. withoutjudgment.
Beer!
Do they have hot cocoa?
Coming up to bat, the new Yankee.
Just up from the Minors, single. So cute.
I can barely see him. Why are we sitting all the way up here?
It's the only place I can smoke without Giuliani putting me away for 10 years.
These seats suck.
This hot dog sucks. My entire Iife sucks.
Your Iife doesn't suck. You have a man who Ioves you.
Love!
I don't think you Iadies understand the seriousness of my situation.
How would you Iike to make Iove to this every night?
Is it kosher?
Don't make me Iaugh. It's tragic.
Can we try and get into the game for a second?
C'mon! Show us what you got.
Last year this guy was Mr. September.
He hit ten home runs in nine days.
Ball! Good eye!
Way to watch them.
He batted.373. He drove in 47 runs.
His onbase percentage was.410.
As Miranda went on about the new Yankee's stats...
...I couldn 't help wondering about my own.
Ten years playing in New York. Countless dates.
Five real relationships. One serious. All ending in breakups.
If I were a ballplayer I'd be batting.... Whatever really bad is.
My God! Here it comes!
You got it!
Do you know what the odds of catching a fly ball are?
I didn't. I couldn't help wondering if they were any higher...
...than finding a relationship that would last.
Three innings, four beers and one shameless flash of my press pass later....
We waited outside the locker room to get my ball signed by the new Yankee.
Good game.
Did you see that bulge?
He was wearing a cup.
His cup runneth over.
It's official, you're drunk.
I'm not drunk, I'm sedated from my pain.
She's allowed to be drunk, she's going through a breakup.
Excuse me. Huge Yankee fan.
We don't mean to bother you but my friend caught your ball.
This is her.
I'm her friend.
We were wondering if you'd sign it?
That foul ball to the upper deck? Yes. I mean....
Yes. If it's not too....
I'm a huge Yankees fan. I'm a Iawyer.
If I don't sign it, you'II sue me?
No. I don't know why I said that.
No problem, give me the ball.
Give him the ball.
Could you hold these? Sure.
You a Yankees fan, too? No, I came for the beer.
I think baseball's a Iittle dull.
What do you do? She writes a column.
A sex column.
Nothin' dull about that. You'd be surprised.
Here you go. Thank you.
He's so cute.
I'm gonna ask him to the Dolce & Gabbana party.
What?
No, really, you can't.
Yankee!
I don't know if it was the beer or the fact that I was holding his ball.
Something gave me the strength to ask the new Yankee out.
No. This is not fair.
This is not the way this is supposed to happen.
Why? You told me to get back in the game.
With some balding C.P.A. or other boring rebound guy.
Nobody rebounds with the new Yankee.
Maybe I'm the new Carrie. Let's blow this hot dog stand.
Samantha, Iet's go.
She knew it was risky, but a day of watching big men...
...swing their big wooden bats proved to be too much for Samantha.
She told herself there's no harm in just looking.
Can I help you?
As my ballpark cheap beer buzz wore off...
...I began to worry about the ramifications of my day.
Was Charlotte right?
Were we supposed to get over an ex in a slow, painful way?
Or should we ignore all the bad feelings and throw ourselves back in the game?
In a world where leaving each other seems to be getting more frequent....
What are the breakup rules?
Whatever you do, man, don't cry.
'Cause if you do get back together again, then, you're the guy that cried.
Don't call or see him 'til three months have passed...
...and you've Iost the weight you put on while breaking up.
Give her whatever she wants, but don't sign a motherfucking thing.
Change your name, change your phone number.
Change your job. They're all bums.
You got a problem?
Friday night, the Dolce & Gabbana party.
The new Yankee was 10 minutes late.
I was running 20 behind.
I was reaching for my favorite necklace when....
I thought I'd destroyed all the evidence, but there it was.
We'd taken it with a disposable camera...
...before it ever dawned on me that we could be disposable as well.
It was then and there I created my own very first breakup rule:
Destroy all pictures where he looks sexy and you look happy.
The party was a complete home run.
All the fashion heavyhitters were there.
Charlotte was dating Paul Ericson...
...the V.P. of a major recording label's classical and jazz division.
Having a good time?
You won't believe it. This guy's never heard Miles Davis.
I don't really Iike that jazz stuff.
I'm gonna give you our Best of Miles Davis CD.
His stuff will change your mind.
His concentration and emotion in the phrasing....
It's fucking magical.
He was handsome, smart, eclectic.
The perfect match for Charlotte.
Except for one minor snag.
The authenticity of Miles' timbre is gonna blow you away.
The fusion revolution changed the entire concept of contemporary music.
There we were, two single gals out on the town with our ballplayers.
What's wrong?
I thought I saw....
Where? No, it wasn't him.
Do you think he'II be here?
I don't know, I hadn't thought about it.
Breakup rule number two:
Lie. It's a lot easier than admitting that's why you invited the new Yankee...
...and why you maxed out your credit card to buy the dress.
When Mr. Big never made an appearance, I decided to make the best of it.
I actually got to know a little about this new Yankee.
His name was Joe.
So, Joe, the new Yankee....
How'd you Iike your first fashion party?
It was kind of cool.
What?
Nothing. It's just....
"Kind of cool."
You're very succinct.
Are you making fun of me?
A Iittle bit.
You're kind of cute.
You're kind of cute, too.
And there, in the shadow of my island...
...just four weeks out of my last relationship...
...I let the new Yankee get to first base.
Our Saturday morning ritual: coffee, eggs, and a very private dish session.
Today our dish wasn't so private.
You're on page six.
"Hot Yankee Joe Stark on the town with New York columnist...
"...and 'sexpert', Carrie Bradshaw."
It's a proud day for me.
That dress just paid for itself. Big is gonna see this and die.
I don't want him to die.
Cut the shit, it's me. You're using that Yankee.
Everybody has got to Iook at my new Palm Pilot.
It's amazing. This is so great.
The first time Big sees you, you Iook great and you're with the Yankee.
Why are we still talking about him? He hurt her.
He's out of the picture.
Let's talk about something else, okay?
I have a problem with my boyfriend.
I'm gonna go get the check.
I don't know really quite how to say this, but he's always...
...touching his
Balls. I know, Carrie told me.
It freaked me out. I didn't know what the hell was going on.
I still don't. What is?
I don't know but it's constant. He can't seem to Ieave them alone.
He and every other guy on the planet.
They always try to pull our attention there.
"Look what I got."
I don't get it. He's from a good family.
He went to Brown. Why is he doing that?
Does he have Iowhangers? Is that a patented phrase?
Sometimes they hang so Iow, they get in the way.
I heard Nick Nolte had a ball Iift.
I don't know how Iong they are.
You've been dating for three weeks and you haven't seen his balls yet?
Get with the program.
But why do men do this?
How would they feel if we stood around in public touching ourselves?
They'd Iove it.
What are we talking about?
Charlotte's boyfriend's balls.
Seriously?
They're too Iong. She's just guessing.
Okay. That's it.
I'm out of here.
AII we talk about anymore...
...is Big or balls or small dicks.
Why do four smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends?
It's Iike seventh grade with bank accounts. What about us?
What we think, we feel, we know...Christ!
Does it always have to be about them?
Give me a call when you're ready to talk about something besides men for a change.
In the case of Miranda Hobbes vs. silly women everywhere, the verdict was in.
Guilty as charged.
After breakfast, Charlotte and I went shopping.
Breakup rule number three:
Until emotionally stabilized, enter no stores.
Later, Samantha and James were about to enter the seventh inning stretch.
When I arch my back, I want you to Iift that ass and really give it to me.
Rather than quit midseason, Samantha decided to attack her problem...
...with the gusto of a seasoned coach training a rookie.
Go, go, Iift. Lift that ass.
Give it to me!
A good coach encourages and motivates.
You are so hot.
Fuck me. You hot stud.
A good coach disciplines and criticizes.
No. What are you doing back there?
Let's go.
And like every good coach...
...she passed on the benefits of her years of experience.
Baby, I'm close.
Get up here and slide inside of me.
Hurry, slide, slide, slide!
Then, at the bottom of the ninth try, with two balls and two strikes.
The coach had no choice, but to bring in a pinch hitter.
What's that?
It's my vibrator.
I thought it would be fun.
I think just us might be more fun.
That's not a problem, is it?
But there was no joy in Mudville.
Mighty Samantha had struck out.
But a little further uptown, the ball game was just getting started.
I have a present for you.
I thought you just gave me one.
I was at Barneys today.
Here.
Charlotte had decided a possible solution to her problem...
...might be as simple as briefs vs. boxers.
The salesman said that these were the very best.
They're Iike the Wonderbra for men.
They give good support, something about the pouch.
We haven't even made Iove and you're out shopping for me?
SIow down.
It's not Iike that
It's what?
But Charlotte couldn't bring herself to tell him the problem was foul balls.
This is too fast. Way too fast.
First comes the underwear, then you move in.
And then the next thing I know, you hate my music.
And that was that.
He broke it off after only three weeks.
Charlotte, true to form, was over him in exactly a week and a half.
Whenever Miranda was feeling stressed, she went for a long walk.
She'd lose herself in the places and faces...
...and whatever was bothering her would somehow lift.
But today, she would have no such luck.
I really thought he Iiked me. Why didn't he call me?
Just when Miranda decided she was the only woman in New York...
...with any real perspective on men....
There he was. Eric Asshole.
The former love of her life.
Walking hand and hand with the woman he left her for.
Somewhere between playing the Royals and the Red Sox...
...the new Yankee found a minute to teach me some dugout pastimes.
One, two, three, toss.
Shit.
If you don't get this, we don't move on to spitting.
Hold my beer.
Back, back, back. Sorry.
Breakup rule number four:
Never stop thinking about him even for a moment...
...because that's the moment he'll appear.
As he made his way through the crowd, I felt calm.
I had accomplished the perfect first meeting.
I looked good, I felt good, and I was with the new Yankee.
Surprise.
Look at you....
I've been....
How've you Good, good, good.
Sorry. This is Joe Stark. I know who he is.
I'm a big fan. Good Iuck this season.
Thanks.
I saw your picture in the paper.
You never Iooked better.
You want another round?
Some buddies are at a bar on BIeeker.
How about it? Sure.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, it's not you. This is....
This is really embarrassing.
I'm sorry. I'm really embarrassed. You're okay.
I don't think I'm okay. I just....
I just cried in your mouth.
I justI can't....
I'm not ready.
That guy in the bar....
That suit guy.
I better go. Sorry.
You want a ride home? No, please.
Don't pay any more attention to me. Just go, please.
Go to that bar thing. I'm just gonna get a cab, all right?
PIease. Will you just go?
AII right, then I'II go.
But I didn't go home. I couldn't.
I went to a pay phone.
It's me.
Hi, Iisten.
I know things are really weird between us right now.
But I really need to talk.
Can you....
Will you meet me at our place in 15 minutes?
Okay.
I saw Big.
And I completely fell apart.
I know you want me to be over him
I'm a jerk.
That's my stuff. It's not you.
I saw Eric on the street today.
And I hid.
After two years.
I forgot how hard it is.
Just take all the time you need, okay?
These are cold.
So?
And finally, the most important breakup rule:
No matter who broke your heart or how long it takes to heal...
...you'll never get through it without your friends.
New York city. Home to one million exciting, eligible, single men...
and four cold and slightly cranky single women.
Well, this is good. We,re actually crossing water to meet men.
Reminder, I am not going to staten Island to meet men.
I am going to judge them.
A perk of being a minor celebrity
is that you get invited to major events.
Like NewYork fire department's
annual calendar competition.
This is a long way to go to watch
some firemen take their shirts off.
I,m on the ferry. I better see more than pecs.
I,m freezing!
I don't understand
why they couldn,t hold the competition
in a bar in Manhattan.
They have firemen
on the Upper East side too.
And they only put out topnotch fires.
Look at how small it looks.
Who would have thought an island that tiny
would be big enough to hold all our old boyfriends.
He loves to cook and can whip up a great baked ziti.
He,s from engine 275, ladder 133,
way out there in Queens.
 Is he hot?  He's a six.
on a scale of how many?
His name was Bill Kelley. He was a divorced politician,
campaigning for New York city comptroller.
And the token male judge.
 Watch the firemen.  I,m more into cops.
He,s a dancer and married. sorry, ladies.
His wife Maria said he,s a good guy but he works too hard.
Work that belly!
Ladies, over here.
oK, they don,t make cosmopolitans, it,s a staten Island iced tea.
 Is that like a Long Island iced tea?  I think so.
Hello, I,m drunk.
Do we have to be this close? It,s embarrassing.
 You gotta be in it to win it.  I,m moving back.
I can,t see the cute firemen from back there without my glasses.
Why do you even care? You have steve.
I do not have steve. There is no having of the steve, we,re just friends.
We,re just friends. I don,t put my dick in you.
Another one of these and I might let you.
There are no datable men here.
What was your first clue? The pleather jackets or smell of... High Karate...?
Ladies, this is Ricky Fantucchi. He,s a capricorn.
His uncles are firefighters.
Yes, ladies, that,s a cheetah on his arm.
Ricky represents engine 53 in Lower Manhattan.
I,d like to show him my Lower Manhattan.
 Look at his arms, they,re huge.  You knowwhat they say.
Big arms... big arms.
Hello, 911. I,m on fire.
After the contest, I began to realize that staten Island
was like a quaint European country.
The American music was 20 years behind
and you could smoke wherever you wanted.
Hi. Are those shirts are for sale? I,d like to get one for my nephew.
Yeah, you could buy,em. But I don,t knowwhere.
I got this one at work, but I,m sure you could buy,em at other places.
 I,ve seen them in those shops...  samantha.
 Ricky, how are you doing?  Good. How are you doing?
 I sawyou up there.  I sawyou too.
 You looked fantastic.  Yeah?
I never did anything like that. My sisters said... Do it, Ricky....
And I said, ... I never did anything like that before....
You did it very well.
 I wonder what month you,ll be.  Maybe october.
 My birthday is in october.  I bet July, or any month that,s hot.
Two songs later, it was time for this dancing queen to take a breather.
Hello. Can I bum a smoke?
 sure.  Thanks.
There you go.
 That,s good. I quit three years ago.  How's that working out for you?
 Good. I allow myself one a week.  You live right on the edge, don,t you?
 can I buy you a beer?  No, I got it.
It's on me. For helping me out in there.
sure. And by the way, you have the worst taste in men...
... ever.  No way.
You gave that guy from Midtown a 7.
I like a firefighter with love handles to hold on to
when escaping a burning building.
 You got a point there.  But you were tough.
And what,s with the halfpoints? 6.5, 8.5?
What can I say? sometimes a girl needs a half.
so, which district do you vote in?
Whichever one is near Barneys.
You,ve never voted in New York city?
correct, Mr. President.
What,s your address? official government purposes.
 I can tell you your district.  officially?
It's 245 East 73rd street.
District 23. Same as mine. I'm at Madison and 82nd.
Fancy. I thought all honest politicians lived in studios
and ate beans out of a can.
I'm not a fan of beans.
can I get your phone number? Government purposes only.
I,m just here with my friends having a good time.
 I,m not into dating right now.  What, bad breakup?
That was a long silence.
Actually, it was a silence and a half.
HaVe dinner with me.
Would it help if I took my shirt off?
Time to go. Politician,s hitting on me.
 And is that a bad thing?  He,s just way too... I,m the guy....
Are you sure? He,s pretty cute.
I don,t want to have to tell you this. I saw him give someone a thumbs up.
We,re out of here. samantha went home with that firefighter.
 Toot toot, beep beep.  And charlotte,s around somewhere.
 How many cocktails did she have?  A couple, why?
And so, three girls headed home,
taking only fond memories of staten Island and its infamous iced teas.
Honey, close up, it,s cold.
 Are you gonna help?  I held her head in the taxi.
You,re so nice, carrie.
 I,m nice too, aren,t I?  Yes, you,re nice.
I'm nice...
I'm pretty and I'm smart. I'm a catch.
Yes, you,re a catch.
I hate you.
You knowwhat? I,m gonna meet the perfect guy and get married.
Yes, you,re getting married.
Did you hear that New York? I,m getting married this year.
I,m getting married and here I come!
If she falls oVer I will neVer stop laughing.
I wasn't quite sure if it was the iced teas
or the staten Island dating pool that broke the camel,s back.
But something set charlotte on fire.
And uptown on dry land, samantha and Mr. July had their own fire going.
You,re so big and strong.
I believe the official fire department count is... a four alarmer....
The next morning at breakfast, Miranda and I wanted poached eggs,
samantha wanted to give us the details
and charlotte wanted to keep her head from exploding
over her raincoat.
I,m telling you, no guy has ever gotten me that wet.
 Pass the salt.  Let me tell you about his cock.
Will you be quiet? The people at the next table have a child.
 That,s their choice.  Miss Hangover,s right.
can we spare the cock talk till cocktail time?
I wanted you to know my fireman was every bit the fantasy I had in mind.
New York's finest.
 That,s cops.  Whatever.
I think it,s wrong to sleep with a man just to fulfill a fantasy.
All the men we sleep with fulfill a certain fantasy.
or nightmare.
You fantasize of a man with a fancy apartment and a stock portfolio.
For me, it,s a fireman with a big hose.
Why are firemen so cute?
Even when they,re not that cute... they,re still cute.
First, there,s a weight limit. second, it,s the hero thing.
 You see him on that truck...  That truck is hot.
...hurrying to save someone trapped.
They,ve got that ... I,m a good guy... look in their eyes.
It,s because women want to be rescued.
The sentence independent single women in their thirties
are never supposed to think, let alone say out loud.
It,s true. I,ve been dating since I was 15, I,m exhausted. Where is he?
 Who? The white knight?  That only happens in fairytales.
My hair hurts.
Did you ever think that maybe we,re the white knights
and we,re the ones that have to save ourselves?
 That is so depressing.  Is it?
Later that day I got to thinking about fairytales.
What if Prince charming had never showed up?
Would snowWhite have slept in that glass coffin forever?
or would she have eventually woken up, spit out the apple, gotten a job,
a healthcare package and a baby from her local sperm bank?
I couldn,t help but wonder. Inside every confident, driven, single woman
is there a delicate, fragile princess just waiting to be saved?
Was charlotte right?
Do women just wanna be rescued?
And after your laser surgery on saturday
you,ll need a significant other or a friend to help get you home.
sign here.
While for some women the idea of rescue was a life raft,
for Miranda it was an insult.
I don,t need anybody to help me. I,ll be fine.
You,ll be sedated and your vision will be blurred.
You will need someone to get you home and to bed.
Then take two sleeping pills, sleep for 12 hours.
Wake up and you,ll be able to see perfectly.
I can,t believe I,m gonna wake up and see clearly
without glasses or contacts for the first time.
BelieVe it.
They slit your eyeball open and flip up the top.
 Gross.  It just flips right up. Flip, my eye.
 oK, stop.  This little blade cuts it. Just...
...like the top of a grape.
It sounds pretty bad.
You want me to come down and hold your hand?
I,m fine. I do not need anyone to hold my hand.
I,m not saying you need anyone.
I,d just like to be there. To help you, whatever.
You,ll need help getting home.
Yeah, I,m gonna ask carrie.
Why do you have to ask carrie when I,m offering?
Because, you know, carrie is my friend.
 oK, and what am I?  We haven,t established that yet.
 Are you coming up?  We haven,t established that yet.
What are we doing here? I mean, are we...
steve, after they flip the eye up, these jets...
And over on the East side at a more charlottefriendly bar,
the ice tea princess began her quest for a white knight.
oh, my God. He,s so cute. cute, right?
very cute. And I,m a professional.
I have to meet him. How am I gonna meet him?
We got here ten minutes ago. Pace yourself.
Hey beautiful. I,m J.J. can I buy those sweet lips a drink?
I,m sorry. We were just leaving.
charlotte was a firm believer in the laws of dating feng shui.
change location, change luck.
Why is it always a guy like that? Is it me?
No, it,s not you. Into every life a little J.J. must fall.
I just want a nice, sweet, handsome, funny, great guy,
who doesn,t say things like sweet lips.
Is that too much to ask?
Hey, you didn,t leave. You,re just over here now.
 Let me buy you a drink.  I,m not interested.
one drink. I,ll even buy blondie here one.
 one little drink.  Excuse me. she,s not interested.
Am I talking to you? No. come on...
 You,re not listening. The lady said...  Hey, fuck you.
 I,m sorry about that.  Did you hurt your hand?
No.
His name was Arthur.
He was a nice, sweet, handsome, great investment banker
who lived between Madison and Fifth.
so, maybe there really were white knights.
The day after charlotte met her knight, I met my credit card limit.
With no man in sight, I decided to rescue my ankles
from a life of boredom
by purchasing too many pairs of Jimmy choo shoes.
Hello, my name is Bill Kelley and I,m gonna be your city comptroller.
 You,re not seriously here.  I assure you I am.
I brought some voter registration forms. I filled out your name.
Under occupation I put heartbreaker. I really did. Look.
You,re like a Jehovah,s Witness with a good suit.
 How long have you been here?  Your number is not listed.
 What did you buy?  shoes.
Let me see. sit down and show me.
 God, you are...  I know.
I,m not showing you a shoe.
sexy.
 Hey, I need a favor.  You do?
It,s for the city of New York. I really am one of the good guys.
I,m carrying all the boroughs but I need help with staten Island.
 You want one?  No, I had one on Thursday.
Here,s the thing. I gotta go back out there
to do a schmooze at the capri restaurant
on sunday night and I want you to go with me.
 And why is that?  Because they have great Italian.
And also, for the record... I can,t stop thinking about you.
I'll pick you up at 7.:00.
 No.  Don't answer now. Think about it.
I,ll drive by at 7.:00. I,ll wait in the car. If you come, you come.
If you don,t, no pressure. Wear the shoes.
These. pass them.
That saturday, when I was unable to take Miranda to her laser surgery
due to a looming column deadline, she didn,t call steve.
she decided to take things into her own hands.
Who needs a man to hold your hand, when you have cab fare
and a black marker to write down emergency numbers?
And while Miranda was under the knife,
charlotte was having her first glass of white wine with her white knight.
I did the Hasty Pudding show a couple of times, to blow off steam.
My friend Tom says that Harvard is still
the most aggressive place he,s seen. And he,s a trader.
 Not Tom Kennedy?  Yes, do you know Tom?
He,s a great guy. And his wife. That,s my idea of a perfect marriage.
Totally.
charlotte nodded, thinking what a nice, sweet, handsome,
funny, great couple they made.
Excuse me, you just bumped into her chair.
 A little crowded.  Yes, but you bumped her chair.
You should say you,re sorry.
 It,s oK.  No, it,s not oK.
 That,s no way to treat a lady.  Lighten up. It,s brunch.
charlotte realized that her date wasn,t a man who came to women,s rescue,
he was a man who liked to start fights.
 Excuse me, sir...  You want a piece of me?
And just like that,
charlotte,s white knight changed into a white nightmare.
Miss Hobbes, your friend is here.
 carrie?  Actually no, it,s me.
carrie thought you might need some help. oK?
I,m on valium, everything,s oK.
 Here, give me your hand.  I,m good.
Just don,t let me hit the door frame and never mention these goggles.
one cab ride and two sleeping pills later, steve put Miranda to bed.
All right. Give me your leg.
No, this leg. I want this leg.
stop! No rescue.
Fine, oK. All right! Put your feet in, sleeping Beauty.
The next morning, after what felt like a hundred years, Miranda awoke.
And for the first time in her life, she sawthings clearly.
That night, Mr. July invited samantha to come down and hang with him
while he worked the sunday shift.
Hello? Where is everyone?
The idea being in a firehouse filled with a calendar hot firemen,
was a fantasy, samantha felt, whose time had definitely come.
Boys!
This was not the firehouse fantasy samantha had in mind.
samantha. I just put a pot of chilli on. come on, sit down.
come on, get up. Make a move for sam.
I,ll be right back.
samantha,s rescue fantasy was suddenly something
she needed to be rescued from.
 It,s me, leave a message.  Hey, I,m still down here in the car.
I,ll wait ten more seconds and then I,ll go alone.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, poor me...
five, four, three, two...
...one. one and a half, sometimes a girl needs a half.
oK, that was my best shot, you,re not coming.
so long... vote!
 I don,t knowwhat I,m doing.  oK.
I,m standing here, fully dressed, watching that politician guy
drive off to staten Island without me. Why?
 You hate staten Island?  Don,t think so. Any other ideas?
Just say it.
Big. You,re terrified of getting hurt again.
There it was. The phrase single, independent women in their thirties
are never supposed to think. Let alone say out loud.
oK, gotta go.
Miranda was right.
I was like a woman frozen on the ledge of a building on fire.
I,d been so burned in my last relationship,
I was afraid to leap off into the next one.
Excuse me for a second.
 Hey. How did you get here?  Ferry.
 All alone?  I,m very independent.
 I can see that.  And this isn,t a date.
I'm a concerned citizen.
A woman on my block won,t pick up after her poodle.
I,ll see what I can do. can I take your coat?
And, Mr. President, it was a bad breakup.
so I need to take this slow.
somewhere between the chilli and halftime,
samantha decided if she wanted her firehouse fantasy to happen,
she,d have to make it happen.
Up here.
Nice pole. Wanna see it again?
Yeah.
samantha rode the pole a couple of times that night.
Why are these boots set up like this?
so we,ll be ready at a moment,s notice.
Well, I should be a fireman, because I am always ready to go.
We,ve got a job.
Get out of my gear. Get the fuck out of my gear!
Let,s go! Move, lady, it,s a fuckin, fire!
I,m coming.
samantha learned there,s quite a difference
between a rescue fantasy and a rescue reality.
It,s getting late. Are you sure I can,t give you a ride?
No, I,m good.
You go... You go and do your thing.
Do I get your vote?
Too fast?
My God, you,re so sexy. come home with me.
Kissing is enough.
It,s enough for tonight, really.
oh, shit. It,s almost 12:00, I,m gonna miss the last ferry.
Wait!
Wait!
I lost my choo.
Need a ride?
He didn,t have a white horse,
but he did have a BMW with a working heater.
so I guess, sometimes a woman absolutely has to be rescued.
 You,re taking me home and that,s it.  That,s it... for tonight.
Now, any idea howwe get the fuck off this island?
oK, make a right.
And sometimes, a woman absolutely has to rescue a man.
At least, that,s how it ends in this staten Island fairytale.
If you are single, there is one thing you should take with you on a Saturday night:
your friends.
Why are we walking so fast?
Are we in that big of a hurry?
 Don't you guys want to go?  I did until I saw this invitation.
Let me see that.
"Two souls, one thought". That is sappy, totally not like Danny.
Must have been her idea. "Two souls, one pushy fiancée".
It's beautiful! A big romantic gesture to express how they feel.
If two people have only one thought, something is very wrong. Cab.
I remember Danny having more than one thought.
 They all involved going up my ass.  You had sex with Danny?
He's cute, straight, and we've known him for ten years. Haven't we all?
 That weekend I was bored.  Just a New Year's Eve kiss.
 I showed him a boob in a checkroom.  Just one?
I sensed he couldn't commit. We're over here.
Baby lamb chops! This is quite a spread.
Two souls, one big budget.
There he was, the fiancé du jour.
 Look who's here!  Congratulations!
 Thanks. My other half, Hailey.  Congratulations!
 Hailey, this is Carrie and Charlotte.  Miranda.
Right! Sorry, I'm just a little overwhelmed.
 Couldn't remember my name?  You should've shown him both boobs.
Across the room from the twosoul couple...
I wanted a Grey Goose on the rocks a fucking hour ago. Chop chop!
...a man with no soul.
Phil, what is it that you do?
I'm a TV agent and I fucking love it.
What a beautiful wedding ring. Where's your husband?
He's not here.
We're taking some time apart.
We're separated, not legally. Nothing legal! God, no!
We're just taking some time to figure things out.
We got married really fast. Love at first sight, didn't think it through.
So now we're talking and trying to figure out what he...
What we, he and l, really want.
We love each other so much,
but that doesn't mean a marriage is working, does it?
We had some problems in the bedroom,
but it was more about the fact that we got married so fast.
So we're trying to figure things out, nothing physical.
It's better if we just talk.
So we are talking till we figure it out. So no, he's not here.
OK. I have to...
Don't talk to her.
Charlotte realised that she and Trey were two souls with too many thoughts.
The minute we met, I knew we were meant to be together.
 I could stop looking. I had found him!  Congratulations!
 What about you guys?  I'm not dating anyone.
And you, Miranda? Seeing anyone special?
No, but I am seeing a whole bunch of unspecial guys.
It's a requirement to date me, "Special? Sorry, move along,
"but if you have unspecial friends, give them my number."
I'm serious! Do any of you have an unremarkable friend
or maybe a houseplant I can go to dinner with?
She's hilarious!
What was going on in there?
Your comedy routine should have a twodrink minimum.
We were in a group of married or engaged women.
 Just trying to avoid the pity party.  It was a cocktail party.
 We were the only single people.  We're the only single people anywhere.
You didn't see all those "Don't worry, you'll find someone" looks?
No, didn't see them.
Society views single people our age as sad and pathetic.
I don't need that, so I go on the offensive and make them laugh.
OK, Shecky.
Sometimes I think couples look at us and wish they had our lives.
No. We make them uncomfortable and they don't know what to say.
 You're sure you're not overreacting?  Yeah.
Coming!
God!
Yes!
What are we doing?
Charlotte. I thought it was the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
I cannot go to any more parties until I know what we're going to do!
 About what?  Us!
I've been up for hours trying to figure out if we should stay together.
I don't want to confuse you, so I made notes.
 You made notes?  It helps me to be clear.
One: sex life.
The sex we had on the floor of your apartment was quite good.
One time does not a marriage make.
Come inside. We can rack up a new score.
Two: you only want me when you can't have me.
Did you make a note that mentions how beautiful you look tonight?
We have some big decisions to make.
Trey!
 You have a boner!  You're so beautiful.
I can't discuss my notes if you have a boner!
 Come inside.  I can't. We're separated!
 I have more notes!  May I take off your panties?
 Don't.  All righty.
You didn't want to be married.
Now I don't know if I want to be married!
Trey, are you...?
That night, neither Charlotte nor Trey came inside.
I'm not quite sure what to say.
I'm sorry, Charlotte. May I get you a hankie?
It's too late for a hankie. This isn't working.
Whatever this is we're doing, it isn't working.
Please stop calling me. I'll call you when I figure out what I want.
Charlotte, I love you.
Send me the drycleaning bill?
Trey may have had a lot of flaws, but bad manners wasn't one of them.
It was a lovely, uneventful Saturday morning.
Three lattes, two newspapers and...
...one datingservice application.
"Dear single". You don't even have a name?
 I'm single, I don't deserve one.  That's a postal driveby shooting.
I thought those 57 menus daily from Hunan Munan were annoying.
"Don't let your soul mate slip away."
It's almost a threat.
"We have him, but hurry because he's slipping... There he goes."
Soul mates only exist in the Hallmark aisle.
I disagree. I believe there's one perfect person out there to complete you.
If you don't find him, you're incomplete? It's so dangerous!
There's only one out there? Why don't I shoot myself right now?
I like to think people have more than one soul mate.
 I've had hundreds.  You miss one, along comes another.
That is not how it works.
But you're saying you're not enough.
 Are you enough?  Today she's too much.
The bad thing about the perfect soul mate is that it's so unattainable.
You feel bad about yourself.
That makes the gap between the Holy Grail and the assholes even bigger.
I don't care. I believe in soul mates.
I thought Trey was mine,
but I don't think that a soul mate would...on your leg.
There's got to be that someone out there for me.
 Maybe I should keep looking.  Here you go.
 Let's fill this out.  I'm not in the mood.
 Not for you, for her.  No!
Yes! Age, check box:
20 to 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 34.
No, not after next week.
Birthday girl, 35.
 35 to 44.  Honey, welcome to my box.
Soul mate. Two little words, one big concept.
A belief that someone, somewhere, is holding the key to your heart
and your dream house. All you have to do is find them.
So where is this person?
And if you love someone and it didn't work out,
does that mean they weren't your soul mate?
Were they just a runnerup in the game show "Happily Ever After"?
As you move from age box to age box
and the contestants get fewer and fewer,
are your chances of finding your soul mate less and less?
Soul mates: reality or torture device?
What about a birthday dinner? Il Cantinori, something nice.
I'm not sure I want to do anything I'm kind of into laying low.
 Laying low or feeling low?  No, I'm fine.
You've got to do better than that!
You've got to grab 35 by the balls and say, "Hey, world, I'm 35!"
I'll put the dinner together. You just show up.
Just close friends. Very fabulous light.
All right. That sounds fun. Thank you.
Should I invite Big?
Are you trying to kill me on the way to lunch?
Technically you are friends now, right?
A phone call here and there. Do you think I should invite him?
How should I know? When I'm done with them, I'm done with them.
Maybe not. I think he's in London. Let's keep it to lowmaintenance friends.
 Welcome. Come in.  He is hot!
 He is a priest.  He is a hot priest!
Look at his robe. It's so Robin and his Merry Men.
You tell them, Friar Fuck!
OK, Sister. Let's go. I won't lose my table at Pastisse
 so you can cruise a holy man.  What street are we on?
That Sunday, Samantha went to church.
 Good morning.  Good morning.
I noticed all the good work you do in the neighbourhood
 and stopped to see if I could help.  We could use a hand in the kitchen.
I'm in public relations. I could put a benefit together,
something classy, respectful.
I can guarantee Donald Trump and Marlo Thomas.
Thank you, but we're a little more lowkey.
We're more about collecting food to feed to the needy.
So...I love your robe.
This is what we wear.
I'm in the Franciscan Order, founded by St Francis. The robe is...
 Do you really want to hear about this?  Tell me more about this St Francis.
He lived his life based on the vows of poverty and chastity.
St Francis giving his coat to the poor.
Samantha Jones, public relations.
If you change your mind about the benefit...
...or anything.
And just like that, Samantha went from Mr No Soul
to Mr All Souls.
After church, most people go out for pancakes.
Samantha wasn't most people.
Your face is glowing. Did you get a facial or something?
 I masturbated all afternoon.  All right, then.
 Seriously? All afternoon?  Two, two and a half hours.
Who has the time? I like to get in and get out.
I enjoy a quickie too, but when it's good, I go with it.
I masturbated to my priest.
 Your priest?  Friar Fuck!
We might have to get Charlotte a crash helmet.
You have a priest?
She wants him but she can't have him. It's all very "Thorn Birds".
He tears the food I'm carrying out of my arms,
rips open my dress, lays me down in the street and enters me.
What do you do for the next 140 minutes?
Stop! You're talking about a priest!
I can masturbate to whomever I like.
It's imagination. It's fun and perfectly healthy.
 Who do you all fantasise about?  Russell Crowe.
 Jinx! You owe me a Coke.  That's amazing.
What did women do before Russell Crowe?
George Clooney.
Clooney's like a Chanel suit. He'll always be in style.
I masturbated to a bus boy who was rude to me once. What does that mean?
Fine, the cheese stands alone.
Charlotte, get that judgmental puss off and join in.
 Who do you fantasise about?  No, it's private.
It can't be worse than a priest and a bus boy.
We're not moving on till you tell us about one of your masturbation guys.
It's not guys. Lately it's just one man.
 LL Bean?  No.
Trey.
And we have really perfect sex.
What do you think it means?
This is 4591905. I'm not in, so please leave a message.
I think you're still in England, but l...
It's midnight here in New York and it's my birthday.
I am officially old.
So I felt the need to call someone...older.
Some friends are giving me a dinner tomorrow. Actually, it's tonight.
You're a friend, so if you are back in town,
it's going to be at ll Cantinori at 8.30.
And if you're still in London...
...then cheerio, old chap.
The next day, on Wall Street...
Sheila! Hi! How are you?
I'm fantastic! Joe and l just got back from New Orleans.
Are you seeing anyone special?
Miranda wasn't feeling very Shecky.
No, I'm not.
He's out there. You just haven't met him yet.
Maybe, maybe not. I don't know if I believe all that.
Maybe there isn't someone for everyone.
There it was: the truth. No Hallmark hope, no twodrink minimum.
How is Joe? You've been married for how many years now?
Five! I bet you're thinking, "Where are the kids?" I said to Joe,
"We can have kids or gorgeous fabric without chocolate stains."
Miranda realised it's not just about being single.
Everyone has a sore spot that needs a comedy routine.
And so Miranda laughed. Not because it was particularly funny,
but because it was kind.
They told me you were inside. Am I disturbing you?
May I join you?
I was thinking about you yesterday. You and the work that you do.
I was at the market.
They're LeSueur peas. They're the best.
That's very kind. Thank you.
I have a confession to make.
I think about you other places than the market.
Do you ever think about me?
I believe that God made the body and it's perfect in its splendour.
But I am not of my body.
My life is about other joys.
Samantha wondered if the hot monk was her soul mate
as he was certainly unattainable.
I arrived at my party after a day of shopping.
With no true soul mate,
I spent the day with my shoesole mate, Manolo Blahnik.
 Good evening, can I help you?  Bradshaw. Party of ten.
You're the first to arrive. Follow me, please.
It's 8:45. The reservation was for 8:30?
That's right. Here you go.
 Enjoy.  Thank you.
 Would you like a drink whilst you wait?  A Shirley Temple, please.
Once everyone's here, we'll be drinking lots of champagne.
Good. Great. Excellent.
20 minutes later, still no party.
Still alone. Did anyone call asking for Bradshaw?
Not that I'm aware of. Let me check.
OK, thanks.
 Can I bring you some champagne now?  No, not yet.
Good. Great. Excellent.
25! Fuck, I'm old!
Sorry for holding the table. I can't imagine where everybody is.
 There's only one ll Cantinori, right?  Yes.
The woman with the birthday cake is here
and she needs to be paid.
I'll just get my purse.
After I paid $70 for my own birthday cake,
I was totally out of the party mood
so I decided to go home and kill myself.
What are you doing? Look where you're standing!
Get the hell off there! No, the other way!
The other way, for Christ's sake!
For crying out loud! Shit!
 I'm sorry.  Marilyn Monroe, get off the road!
I'm sorry!
Shit! I'm sorry!
By the time I got home, I had fallen into an emotional hole so deep
only a fireman without a collarbone could rescue me.
You have 14 messages.
I'm trapped at work, I'll be ten minutes late. See you soon.
Carrie, I'm in traffic. They're paving Fifth Avenue!
Don't wait for me, happy birthday!
I'm stuck in traffic, I can't spell ll Cantinori for the idiot at 411, get a cell phone.
Carrie, it's Stanford. I'm at the wrong place.
Did you know there's a Mexican restaurant called El Cantinoro?
I'm here. They said you left.
Where are you? We're still here.
We're coming uptown to meet you at the coffee shop.
 20 minutes.  End of messages.
It's just me! It's just me, Charlotte!
I just aged 35 more years.
 What are you doing here?  I'm taking you to the coffee shop.
No, I'm going to bed. I am not in the mood to be with people.
You have to come. It's your birthday.
I am aware of that!
The longer I sat at the table, the more alone I felt.
It really hit me: I am 35 and alone.
 You are not alone.  No, I know I have you guys.
I hate myself for saying this, but...
...it felt really sad
not to have a man in my life who cares about me.
No special guy to wish me happy birthday.
No goddamn soul mate.
I don't even know if I believe in soul mates.
Don't laugh at me, but maybe we could be each other's soul mates.
Then we could let men be just these great, nice guys to have fun with.
That sounds like a plan.
 I'm 35. 35 is not 25.  Thank God!
I'm 35!
Shut the fuck up. I'm 140.
Happy birthday, baby.
Get in.
 It's after 12. You're late.  Not really. I'm on London time.
 London is five hours ahead.  In that case, I'm really late.
I can't believe you actually got out of the car and got balloons.
I didn't. Raoul did. Good man.
So...
 How old are you?  How old are you?
You don't have to give me an exact number.
Pick a box. 30 to 35?
35 to 40? 40 to 45?
Really? 40 to 45.
I don't know what you mean. I had something in my eye.
How do you feel about soul mates?
Well, I like the word "soul".
I like the word "mate". Other than that, you got me.
 Did you have a nice day?  I had a fabulous day.
Good for you.
As Big's car drove away,
I realised having three soul mates already nailed down
made it a lot easier to spot those great, nice guys to have fun with.
When you are single in New York,
there is no end to ways to fill your days.
Museums, parks, theatres, concert halls,
nightclubs and countless restaurants.
But one of the most amazing things
about living in New York
is that any night, you can go...
to Paris.
''Joy For Two'' for one.
Enjoy the show.
Thank you.
lt was one of those perfect New York nights.
That fucking Richard.
A less than perfect day.
He left an ''l'm sorry'' message.
Like that makes up for eating another woman's pussy.
Samantha!
lt's OK. Nothing has to change.
 Think of this as a big purse.  Your purse just spit up.
You'd think after three weeks he'd get the message.
Not OK to eat another woman's pussy.
 Samantha, Brady!  l'm pissed off.
 What am l supposed to say?  Call it another woman's sushi.
Fine. Richard ate her sushi.
Fish and chips would have been an unfortunate order.
 What did you do last night?  A movie.
 With who?  Myself.
 On date night?  Will we call it that in our 50s?
People would be thinking, ''That poor, pathetic girl.''
 Like how l'm looking at you now?  What?
 You don't go out alone?  On date night?
New York is the perfect place to be single. The city is your date.
 You're dating the city?  About 18 years.
lt's getting serious. l think l'm in love.
 Do not check your messages.  l'm not.
l wanted you to hear his tone on my machine.
lf you keep participating, you might as well call him.
 l'm not participating.  This has to stop.
lt's tragic you were in love and it didn't work.
You have to emotionally cut him out and the sooner, the better.
Everyone knows you only get two great loves.
 Where did you get that?  ln a magazine.
''Convenient Theories For You Monthly''?
 What does that mean?  When you were married,
 you believed in one great love.  What does ''great love'' mean?
A love that changes you, that shakes you to your core,
after which you're never the same. Seriously.
There is not unlimited love in the world. lt's rare.
Way to take the edge off a club sandwich.
So far l've had one...Trey. How many have you had?
 Zero.  Really? What about Steve?
Steve's a friend, not a core shaker.
l'm done with great love. l'm back to great lovers.
 You?  l refuse to define love in those terms.
 l had to.  Come on, Carrie. Aidan and Big.
One, two. According to you, l'm done.
No, it was a stupid article. lt was at the dentist.
No, it's too late for that. You said it. lt's over for me.
Here lies Carrie. She had two loves and lots of shoes.
Fuck love.
l gave you ''sushi'', l need ''fuck''.
After a light lunch,
Miranda stopped to set down a heavy load.
 You want me to carry him?  l've just got to switch.
Ladies, seamen, 12 o'clock.
l pray when l turn around there are sailors.
With her, you never know.
Oh, wow!
We have just spotted our first sailors. Fleet Week has begun.
Fleet Week is that one week a year
when the US Naval ships dock,
and our fair city is made even fairer
with cute, sweet, American sailors looking for fun.
l've been so distracted by Richard. l almost forgot my favourite holiday.
 lt isn't a holiday.  lt should be.
The antidote to Valentine's Day.
Just what l need. l'm gonna find out about the big party.
 Hold on, Pearl Harbor. Not interested.  We always have fun.
Running through Times Square in heels, to find a sailor to kiss.
That ship has sailed, pun intended.
We have to. lt's our patriotic duty as women of New York.
lf you want to do your patriotic duty as New York women,
you will come shopping and throw some much needed money downtown.
 l'm in.  l'm in.
l...forgot the Snuggly.
Well, let's get you a cab home. There's one. Taxi.
Oh, OK.
 l'll call you later?  Overspend for me.
 OK.  l'm OK. l've got it.
 Byebye.  Bye.
l'll call you later.
Miranda suddenly found herself moving slowly away from her old life.
And quickly into her new one.
Oh, baby boy. Big baby.
Look at that big face.
Here, let Magda...
l'm good. l've got it. You keep doing the thing, the mirror.
 The nurse will put him down for a nap.  On floor?
 Lina?  ls that my big boy?
Hi, what are you doing here?
l came over to hang with B boy. Magda let me in.
 Hey, champ! Want half a sandwich?  Where'd you get...?
OK, Steve?
l can't have you hang. l've got a schedule.
l've gotta get Brady down for a nap or he won't sleep tonight.
 Lina!  How's your nipples?
 Excuse me?  Lina said they get sore.
Lina, would you get Brady ready for his nap?
And don't talk to Steve about my nipples. Thanks.
 Don't blame her. l asked.  You asked about my nipples?
l talk about your nipples to strangers all the time.
 Ha ha, ho ho. Bye!  Hey, hey.
l came over to help.
l appreciate that but l've hired help.
 Everything's under control.  Thanks for the eats.
Have a good evening, Mrs MacDougal.
Charlotte realised she may have put great love number one behind her,
but his name was still in front of her.
Breakups. Bad for the heart, good for the economy.
lt's the bad guy again. l'll keep calling till you agree to talk.
Unless you want 20 messages every day, meet me tonight.
l miss you. l'll be waiting, gorgeous.
Right sentiment.
Sushi Samba.
Wrong restaurant.
Richard Wright? Right this way.
Hello, gorgeous.
ln a wildly optimistic gesture, l ordered you a dirty martini.
Dirty martini?
Dirty bastard.
l have always wanted to do that, but l don't think l could.
 How did it feel?  Fabulous.
But l woke up this morning even angrier.
l need to hurt him more. l can't be around that man. He's toxic.
 So, he's ''manthrax''?  Arrogant prick!
l wonder what he was gonna say.
That he loves me, we belong together,
he didn't mean to hurt me.
People make mistakes. l cheated on Aidan.
He gave me a second chance.
Look how that turned out.
That was different.
 True. lt wasn't a sushi situation.  That's another thing.
l'm not doing the baby talk at breakfast.
l signed up for friendship, not bullshit baby brunches.
You're overreacting. Brady won't happen every day.
 He'd better not.  Miranda's still Miranda.
She had a baby, not a lobotomy. She knows you're not childfriendly.
Don't kid yourself. Days of ''pussy'' and ''fuck'' are gone.
Later that night, l got to thinking about days gone by.
That carefree time when our schedules were as open as our hearts.
The time before the baggage and babies began to weigh us down.
l couldn't help wonder,
does that sense of adventure still flicker inside us?
Or when it comes to being carefree single girls,
have we missed the boat?
Surprise! Pain au chocolat.
Oh, l'm sorry. l don't know you.
l'm Carrie. l'm a friend of...
Hi, this is Lina. Come in.
 Does she speak?  No, l love her.
Were we supposed to do something and l forgot it?
No, l had the day free and thought l'd stop by for a chatty.
 Fatty, come on. l've gotta sit.  Are you hungry?
l brought some pain au chocolat.
Thanks, but the only eating l'm concerned with now is Brady.
 He doesn't want to eat.  Perhaps he's anorexic.
 Sorry, what?  lt's a dumb joke.
 What was it?  Anorexic.
Oh, yeah...no.
l've been trying to feed him for an hour and he won't latch on...
Stop. Boring. What's up with you?
Well, l've been thinking about that thing
that Charlotte said in the coffee shop.
About the great loves?
Here we go.
So...maybe Aidan and Big are my two great loves, now.
But...
that doesn't mean that... that l'm always gonna feel
 that way about them.  Come on, Brady. lt's right here.
OK, you don't want it? Fine. Here we go.
There, in the middle of my two great loves,
were Miranda's two great breasts.
l'm sorry. What?
Your breasts are huge!
No, what were you saying?
l can't even remember. This is so frustrating.
 He'll eat eventually.  No, not that.
This is frustrating. l can't follow your thoughts.
lt's all nursing and nipples.
Sweetie, they're looking right at me.
l am not gonna become one of those mothers
who cannot carry on an adult conversation.
l am not.
Three weeks ago, l would've been listening and saying funny things.
Now l'm going, ''What?'' l didn't get the anorexic joke.
 How easy was that?  l'm just talking. lt's just words.
They're your words. lt's not just now.
Could Samantha have gotten me into that cab faster?
Carrie, my friendships are...
important to me.
We're not going anywhere. Things will have to change a little.
 Fuck.  l know.
But you're still one of us.
Only now, you're the one with the biggest boobs.
Can you believe the size of my nipples?
l was not at all prepared.
l'm gonna have to find some trauma counselling.
There. We have contact.
OK. l'm gonna go. Let you concentrate on Mr Hobbes.
You don't have to go. l can listen now. l can do it.
Miranda, you're a mother.
 But it's OK. l won't tell anyone.  Don't.
What are you going to do all day?
First a trip to the Guggenheim and then lunch and then...
 Who knows? lt's New York.  Hot date with your city?
Exactly. See that? You listened and we had the witty repartee. Bye.
That same afternoon, Charlotte felt like going to a movie.
She called her afternoon movie friend, Anthony.
Carrie says the French film at The Paris is amazing.
Fuck the French. Like l need to spend an afternoon looking at that shit.
 Good hat.  Thanks. What do you want to see?
 Anything with Josh Hartnett.  l don't know him.
He's cute, with a capital 'U'...
He totally checked you out. Get his number.
 He's a sailor.  l know! Hurry! He's getting away.
 l can't do that.  You are so not gay.
 What am l going to do with him?  Fuck him!
Put an end to that Park Avenue, pink shirt, flaccid mojo
 you've been dragging around.  l'm not dragging anything around.
l changed my name back to York on my mailbox.
Good for you. Maybe you should be thinking about a different box.
When did you last have sex?
lf you have to think, it's been too long.
 When was the last time...?  10:30 today at the gym.
l'm not looking for just sex. l can have just sex.
l'm looking for my next great love.
Don't let it hit that six month mark.
After that, it's a sleigh ride into menopause.
lf you don't put something in there soon, it will grow over.
What is it with this friggin' wind?
As Charlotte and Anthony made a left,
Samantha found herself in the right neighbourhood, Richard Wright's.
Here you go. Thank you. One for you.
Ma'am. lt's against city law to deface public property.
This man said he loved me,
and l caught him eating another woman's pussy.
Carry on, ma'am.
New York weather, like a man, can be unpredictable.
But that's part of the fun.
And a New York museum, like a man, can sometimes be closed
when you wish they were open.
That's another reason l love New York. Just like that,
it can go from bad to cute.
Well, l guess we're not going anywhere for a while.
l love the way the rain smells.
lf this were a French movie, we'd fall in love and get married.
No, l was just pointing out how romantic this would be in a movie.
l don't want to marry you.
OK, l do!
Come on. l'm kidding. We just met. Let's wait five minutes.
l don't want to get married. l was engaged last year,
and if l didn't want to marry him...
 Singles at the counter.  l was hoping to get a table...
Singles, counter. Two! Two!
 OK, thank you.  Two!
Who's next?
Several blocks later, l decided to warm up with a bowl of matzo ball soup.
Come on, come on! Let's go!
That manager's really a prick.
l put up with it because l come here all the time.
They know me. l live in the neighbourhood.
We single gals got to have a port in a storm. Am l right?
Lithium. l like to sprinkle it on my ice cream.
 Ever try it?  No, can't say that l have.
What kind of mood elevator are you on?
l'm not on one.
Yeah? l used to be like you. Then l broke up with this guy.
This was '82. Morty.
Thought somebody better would come along.
Never happened.
Oh, l love this!
lf Charlotte was right, this woman's two great loves
were a man named Morty and lithiumlaced ice cream.
After 20 minutes squatting under the coffee shop hand dryer,
l realised l'd been kidding myself.
New York and l didn't have the perfect relationship.
All right!
lt was dismissive, abusive, and it made me feel desperate.
l was now fresh out of great loves.
Hey, sir!
Thank you.
Should l?
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Louis Laroy.
This is Bill Hope and Paul Watkins.
We'd like to invite you to a navy party tonight.
 Feel free to bring some girlfriends.  Feel very free.
l don't know why l was fighting it. This will be fun!
Exactly what we needed. Three single gals back on the town.
What's the longest you've gone without sex?
You don't get that info without dinner and a drink.
Next week will be six months.
Thanks. She threw me and l lost my concentration.
l am gonna have sex with a sailor tonight.
 She almost got me on that one.  l have to have sex
to put Mrs Trey MacDougal behind me. l'm a new Charlotte York.
 What about the great loves?  Maybe that was bullshit.
Gotcha.
 How are we gonna find your sailor?  We'll find him.
God bless America.
The important thing is to stick together or we'll get lost.
Samantha! Charlotte!
Yeah. Oh, yeah. There.
And uptown, another woman found herself in a confusing navel situation.
Look, Brady. There's your bellybutton.
Help me!
20 freaked out minutes later...
l can't do this. l'm prepared for the expected,
but not the unexpected. l can't schedule shit like this.
And the people you hire won't help you!
Where's the cat?
Oh God. Steve, it's gross.
 Help me. lt's gross.  Relax. l'll give you a hand.
He may not be a core shaker,
but Steve was there when she was shaken to the core.
You looking for someone?
My girlfriends. This party's like the Bermuda Triangle for women.
 That's a little sailor joke.  You're funny.
 You remind me of my mom.  Byebye.
 Evening, Miss.  Ahoy, matey! Nice dicky.
Meanwhile, l had not found Charlotte,
but Charlotte had found an officer who wasn't a gentleman.
 Show me your tits?  l can't do that. l barely know you.
OK. Just show me one. lt's an order.
The old Charlotte would've had him courtmartialled, but the new one...
 Well, officer.  ...had a deadline.
lf it's an order.
 Jesus!  Carrie!
l was just looking for you. l didn't...
 This is Officer Matt Cook.  l'll see you later.
l can't do this. Let's just talk.
lt's your call, Ma'am.
Charlotte was caught somewhere between the old and new York.
She figured showing her boob to a stranger
bought her three months.
Carrie! There you are. Where's Charlotte?
Believe it or not, she's involved in a peep show upstairs.
l'm starting to have a newfound respect for that girl.
What is it about today? l've seen Miranda's boobs, Charlotte's boob.
Why not show me yours and get it over with?
l was kidding.
l wasn't. That ought to hook me a sailor.
Yeah, Tailhook you one. l'm going.
 No!  Yes. l was right.
This ship has sailed and tragically, l'm still on it.
Good night. Hey, keep an eye on Boom Boom up there.
Hey, there. You came.
 Yes. l came, l saw, l'm leaving.  Come on.
l've come all the way from Louisiana to dance with a New York city girl.
l'm a good dancer.
Even though she was floating in a sea of dickies...
One new message and 12 saved messages.
...Samantha could only think about Richard.
You threw a drink in my face and papered my neighbourhood.
Would l still call if l didn't really love you?
l love you, gorgeous. Give me another chance.
You threw a drink in my face and papered my neighbourhood.
Would l still be calling if l didn't really love you?
Say, Louis from Louisiana,
how many great loves do you think you get in a lifetime?
Great loves?
That is the question on deck.
Maybe one, if you're lucky.
Well, l'm glad l stayed.
After this city kicked my ass today, l needed that dance.
l have to say, this is my first trip to New York.
Not for me.
The garbage, the noise. l don't know how you put up with it.
Thanks. Goodnight.
Wait.
Going home all alone?
 lt's rough out there.  lt isn't so bad.
lf Louis was right, and you only get one great love,
New York may just be mine.
l can't have nobody talking shit about my boyfriend.
A short while later, l had a thought.
Maybe the past is like an anchor holding us back.
Maybe you have to let go of who you were...
to become who you will be.
Two years ago, my friend Susan Sharon...
...the East Coast rep for a line of Italian cashmere sportswear...
...married a mean man.
What did I tell you about Iistening to my CDs?
You put Natalie Imbruglia back in U2!
Now, I only see her once or twice a year...
...generally when her husband is out of town.
Now, I can't remember if I've taken my Halcion before dinner or not.
So I take another one, I have a cocktail, I'm feeling no pain.
The next thing I know, this freaked out stewardess is slapping me awake.
I open my eyes, I Iook around the plane, it's completely empty.
We'd Ianded in Milan 30 minutes ago. My God.
Come up to my apartment because I have something for you.
The place Iooks fantastic!
Richard's asleep.
In here?
Susan Sharon and her husband had one of those very adult apartments...
...that made me feel like I was 16 visiting the home of a friend...
...whose parents thought I was a bad influence.
Happy birthday, Carrie.
You didn't have to.
I know it's a Iittle early.
It's beautiful.
It's 100 percent Italian cashmere and Iight as a feather.
God, I Iove it.
It's a "cashmereical."
Guess what Barneys gets for this. Don't tell me.
$900. $900 for a scarf? No.
Do you mind if I return it? I need cash. Why not?
Why do you think they call it "cashmere"?
What the hell is going on? Sorry, honey.
But Carrie had this idea about returning What...
...was our agreement about visitors after 9:00 p.m.?
I know, it's her birthday. I'm on London time!
I've got to be up in three hours when the markets open.
I'd really appreciate it if you'd take the fucking noise somewhere else.
I'II call you. Just ignore him. You don't have to Ieave.
It's okay.
Goodnight, Grumpy. Get the fuck out of my house!
Taunting the psychotic spouse, I realized, was not a wise move.
Just shut the fuck up!
I wondered...
...could their marriage be that bad, or was their fighting a form of foreplay?
In which case, I was merely the catalyst to get things going.
I am so sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
He's just tired and cranky.
That was classic Richard:
Tyrannical, emotionally abusive. I don't know what to do anymore.
Maybe there were special circumstances tonight.
He works hard. He's sleep deprived.
BIah, blah, blah. I don't give a shit!
What would you do? Would you Ieave?
If things didn't change....
They haven't, and they won't.
Do you think I should Ieave him?
If you're not happy, you know, Iife's too short.
I gotta go.
As I hung up, I realized I had been placed in a classic nowin situation.
Telling a friend to Ieave her husband is something you just don't do.
If they do break up, it's your fault.
If they don't, she knows you think they should...
...and therefore, can't speak to you again. You're screwed.
It's a shame. There goes your cashmere connection.
She had me at a weak moment. I was tired, I'd been chased out of her apartment.
I have a birthday Iooming.
I said too much. No, in an intimate relationship...
...you should be able to say anything. I disagree.
Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of Iies...
...and mutual delusion.
James and me, for instance. I pretend he doesn't have a small dick.
He pretends not to notice we haven't had sex in weeks.
You should join the U.N.
I'm in an intimate relationship at the moment...
...and I can tell you, the Ievel of verbal discourse has become a Iittle too intimate.
Are we speaking of Spring Roll Guy? Who's that?
Aaron Melman.
He's a dermatologist I met at the Vietnamese Iunch truck outside my office.
What's the problem?
The problem, if you can call it that...
...is Spring Roll Guy liked to talk dirty in bed.
Baby, I just Iove the way your pussy feels.
So wet...
...and warm...
...and tight.
Kissing your beautiful tits feels unbelievably sexy.
So hot and nasty.
How's it feel to you?
What you said.
That can be a turn on.
Sure, but now he wants me to reciprocate.
I can't. I never could.
Why not?
Because sex is not a time to chat.
It's one of the few instances in my overly articulated, exceedingly verbal Iife...
...where it is perfectly appropriate, if not preferable, to shut up.
Now I have to worry about being stumped for conversation?
No, thank you.
Just talk about his big cock.
Correction, his big, beautiful cock.
We're using the "C" word now? Sorry.
I can't use adjectives. A simple, "You're so hard," is effective.
Sometimes men need encouragement. Such as?
You know....
"Yes, stud, that's right.
"Don't stop, just Iike that. C'mon, fucker, don't stop."
You're kidding, right?
No, they Iike it.
So, are you really telling us...
...that during sex you're completely mute?
No, I can do a good orgasm alert.
"I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum."
But that's because I'm gonna cum.
Anything else feels Iike make believe.
If you really Iike this guy, you're gonna have to start talking.
Was Miranda right?
Have we put such a premium on being open and honest with one another...
...that we've misplaced the boundaries of propriety?
Are there still certain things in a relationship one should never say?
My best friend got engaged to the biggest Ioser.
What am I supposed to say? "You're marrying an imbecile?"
My wife, she's had her breasts done twice.
They Iook fantastic, they feel Iike shit.
I keep that thought to myself.
I'm single, 38, and still hoping to get married. I don't want to know the truth.
I told Richard I couldn't spend another day married to a man who is an utter asshole.
There it was, standing across from me.
Biscottieating, cashmereswaddled proof that I had said too much.
Then what happened? Once I said that, the floodgates opened.
He said that at our wedding, when he Iooked at me...
...he felt a huge wave of disappointment because I Iooked so generic.
I said, "On second thought...
"...I don't think the Rogaine is working."
He said that if I Ieave, all he'II feel for me is pity...
...because he'II be remarried within a year and I'II be single for the rest of my Iife.
I didn't want to tell Susan Sharon that his last statement was probably true.
I just feel Iike I owe you so much.
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have had the guts to do this.
It's Iike I was under house arrest for years and now I'm free.
What are you gonna do?
Do you mind if I stay at your place?
Of course not.
That evening, as Susan Sharon squatted on my couch...
...Charlotte came home to the new male in her life.
Fed up with lonely mornings, cuddlefree nights...
...and the lack of unconditional love she longed for...
...Charlotte took matters into her own hands.
She combed the city for the perfect specimen of breeding, style and trendiness.
Henry, I'm home.
Hi, my good boy.
Until she found the perfect man, Charlotte would have the perfect dog.
That night, Samantha, who was never good at keeping a secret...
...found the one thing she couldn 't say was the only thing she could think about.
Sweetheart, is anything wrong? If there is, I want you to tell me.
No, honey, I'm tired.
I feel Iike you've become so distant, Iike you're upset with me about something.
I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me.
I'm not upset about anything.
You're wonderful.
Will you come see a couple's counselor with me?
Samantha dreaded the shrink the way most people feared the dentist.
If it's really important to you
Great.
Goodnight.
She longed for the simple days...
...of emotional unavailability and hot onenight stands.
Meanwhile, across town, Miranda was appearing as Eliza Doolittle...
...in My Filthy Lady.
I just Iove kissing this sensitive spot right here.
Do you Iike that?
Tell me what you Iike.
That.
You Iike my hand there, caressing your breast?
Sure.
Gently pinching your nipple.
Fine.
Kissing my chest.
That's hot. That really turns me on.
How's it feel?
Hot?
Hot.
And?
Hairy? God, you're getting me hard.
Tell me how it feels.
Big.
And?
Hard?
Rock hard. Keep talking.
A big rock.
A hard rock.
A big, hard rock.
A sausage. Baby, you are so nasty.
Surprisingly, once Miranda opened her mouth, it was difficult to shut up.
A big, throbbing, rockhard sausage.
That night, I took Susan Sharon to meet the new male in Charlotte's life.
True to form, he was already falling far short of her high expectations.
He did it a minute ago.
He was inconsistent...
Get the ball.
...selfishly stubborn, and hopelessly codependent.
Isn't he smart?
We can't stay, I want to be at your place if Richard calls.
Aren't you Ieaving him?
If he calls, I want to say I won't talk to him.
That's passive aggressive. You should only talk if you have something to say.
Do you believe I married a prick? You didn't know he was a prick.
I just can't believe that prick hasn't called.
AIthough, he does have this sweet side. You just don't know him very well.
Did I do the right thing, Henry? Should I give him another chance
He's a dog, not an oracle.
The next morning, I woke up to an unsettling birthday surprise.
Coming.
Sign here.
Thank you.
My God.
"Best wishes on your birthday."
It's from Big.
What kind of flowers? Roses, red.
Big.
Expensive.
What do you think it means? It means rip up the card.
And watch out for the thorns.
No, this is the grand gesture.
The grand gesture?
If you break up, and he disappears from your Iife...
...it wasn't meant to be.
But if they make a powerful declaration of their Iove, then you have to reconsider.
You think a dozen roses and a card saying, "Best wishes" qualifies as a grand gesture?
You know men. They can never say, "I was wrong." They just send flowers.
Sometimes a rose is just a rose.
Jewelry, that's another story.
Henry, no.
Henry, no, not the purse.
I really don't need this on my birthday.
What does this mean, the ball's in my court or something?
I don't want to play games.
This is not the grand gesture. This is the vague gesture...
...which is worse than no gesture.
Under the guise of thoughtfulness, he's being very selfish.
I agree, he's muddied the waters.
You're all just cuckoo. He sends flowers on her birthday and you condemn him.
Henry, no. No, damn it.
For chrissake, give the dog a break.
He's eaten four pairs of shoes. I don't want him starting on purses.
Damn it, now. We're gonna go home.
You wanted to get out and socialize, but you'II have to Iearn to behave.
Speaking of cuckoo....
Charlotte was at the point where she was starting to see the real Henry.
But she did raise a valid question.
Was, "I was wrong, " the one thing Mr. Big couldn 't say?
I realized that just because we were no longer together...
...didn 't mean I couldn 't be polite.
It's me.
Carrie.
How are you?
Great. I wanted to call and thank you for the flowers.
That was thoughtful of you.
My secretary had it on her calendar, so I, you know....
Your secretary sent them?
I sent the flowers, my secretary alerted me to the day.
That was very thoughtful of her and you for sending them.
You're welcome. What are you doing on the big day?
Stanford's arranged this party down at Layla, that Moroccan restaurant.
You should come.
The instant the words popped out of my mouth, I regretted them.
I made plans already.
Or not. I mean, just forget it.
I could stop by Iater.
Fine. Whatever.
I may bring someone.
Come and bring that person and maybe I'II see you Iater.
Thank you again for the thoughtful flowers.
I couldn't believe it.
I had just invited my ex and his date to my birthday party.
As if getting older wasn't traumatic enough.
That afternoon in the office of Velma Rudin...
...celebrated psychologist and author of Intomesee...
...A Couple's Guide to Intimacy...
...Samantha did her best not to say the thing she knew she shouldn 't say.
I've noticed that our sex Iife has diminished.
That's normal, isn't it? I mean, after a while
How Iong has it been?
A month.
Don't take it all so seriously.
Have fun with your sexuality.
Have you tried playing erotic games?
Samantha almost confessed that James...
...had been playing "hide the salami" since they met.
I'm just not feeling very sexual these days.
I saw you masturbating the other day when I came out of the shower.
Many women are simply unable to achieve orgasm through intercourse.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
You have a problem with intimacy.
No, that's not it.
What is it? It's nothing.
Nothing you say can hurt me, as Iong as it's what you're feeling.
That seems to be all the time we have for today.
Nice work, you two.
Shall we say next week, same time?
Good for me.
The idea of seeing Velma "Intomesee" Rudin on a weekly basis...
...was much more than Samantha could bear.
Your penis is too small.
Excuse me?
It doesn'tand it justit can't.
I can't.
It's just too damn small.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe your vagina is too big?
What can I say? I need a big dick.
I hear that.
As Samantha paid the price of mentioning the unmentionable...
...Miranda discovered that free speech comes with a cost of its own.
I just Iove putting my hand around your cock.
I just Iove hearing you say "cock."
Your big hard cock.
Cock, cock, cock.
Why couldn't I ever say that before?
It's just a word.
Why does it turn us both on when I say it?
What else do you Iike?
I Iike it when you're rough.
When you throw my Iegs over your head, I Iose control.
What do I Iike?
You Iike it when I'm biting your nipple.
What else?
You Iike it when I'm kissing your balls.
Keep going.
You really Iike it when I slip my finger in your ass.
Excuse me?
You just Iove a finger in your ass.
How could I know, "You Iove a finger in your ass"...
...is the one thing you can't say?
Trust me, that's not the only thing.
But it's true, he enjoys it. So do a Iot of men.
They enjoy it, but don't want it brought to their attention.
Personally, I don't Iike anything in my ass.
I know that may come as a surprise.
I just feel so betrayed.
He wanted me to talk dirty, I got into it, then he pulled the rug out from under me.
Men are so frustratingly inconsistent. That's why I Iove my Henry.
He's a big Iove bug. You tell him anything and he Iicks your face.
Charlotte, you may be onto something.
Another double vodka rocks for the birthday girl.
The truth was, vodka was my only ally.
At any moment, Big was gonna walk in with his gorgeous date...
...smile at me like some distant stranger and say something crushing
Happy birthday, baby.
GIad you could make it.
I can't stay Iong.
I Ieft my camel outside.
You remember Jack?
Jack is your date?
I wasn't aware we were formally dating, but
It is so good to see you again.
How have you been?
Marvelous, I split up with a bitch who broke my heart. She didn't get my money.
Happy birthday to me.
An hour later, my Arabian Nights fantasy...
...birthday felt like Midnight Express.
How are you? Great.
How are you?
Good. Fine.
Good.
Excuse me, what is your ex doing at your birthday?
I told him to drop by for a drink.
I didn't think he'd stay for a Iap dance.
My God, have you tried the baba ganooj?
It is to die for.
I don't eat baba ganooj.
You don't know what you're missing.
I can't believe the bastard dared to come.
I can't believe what she does with her navel.
PIease, I'm about to Iose my couscous.
While I watched my ex get a Mesopotamian lap dance...
...Susan Sharon made a play for Mr. Marvelous.
I can't deal with being single all over again.
Every relationship has its ups and downs.
My husband and I work very hard.
We probably don't spend enough damn time together.
Compounded by the fact that neither of us gets enough sleep. Then again, who does?
I really never imagined myself as a divorcee, you know?
It's more important to till your own soil than to go in search of greener pastures.
Do you ever shut the fuck up?
In that moment, Susan Sharon realized she desperately missed her husband.
That night, Charlotte came home to a very unpleasant surprise.
Bad!
Charlotte realized, like so many males before him...
...Henry had shit all over her perfect world.
He and Charlotte soon parted ways.
The one thing she could never say was, "I got rid of the puppy."
We all know what happened to him.
He'd become the glue that put Susan Sharon and her husband back together.
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.
Although neither of them could admit that a dog saved their marriage.
Later that evening, as my birthday passed into the early hours of just another day...
...I found myself alone on the street with Mr. Big.
Another year older.
And none the wiser.
That's the way it goes.
Can I give you a ride home? No, I'm just gonna grab a cab.
Do you need cab fare? No, I'm okay.
Good, because I think I Ieft all my $20 in that belly dancer's crotch.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
As I watched him go, I realized the one thing I couldn't say to Mr. Big was...
... "I'm still not over you. "
for three weeks.
Since most of our time was spent campaigning, I dressed the part.
I found some vintage Halston
and did a spin on Jackie Kennedy.
The early years.
Who here knows
what a city comptroller does?
You do?
We made a good match.
I was adept at fashion, he at politics.
This city's populace's passion,
love and devotion to their home...
Really, they're both about recycling ideas
and making them seem fresh and inspiring.
It is this love affair, this symbiotic relationship between citizens and city,
that I promise to cherish and protect.
Thank you.
Great guy!
Yes, he is.
can we talk about proposition 114?
 What is that?  You and me in the bedroom.
 Is that on the ballot?  It ought to be. I'd back it.
And that's whatever position you want.
Which way is the bedroom?
Put me down.
That was the night I had my political consciousness raised.
How about a movie Wednesday night?
Wednesday? I'm not sure. I might be working.
Thursday, then.
oK, maybe Thursday. I'll see.
Do you have plans?
Steve, you can't just assume I'm gonna be free every night.
Is it a date?
It could be a date, so I wouldn't necessarily share that with you.
 I'd like to know. Who are you dating?  Nobody in particular.
 Anybody specific?  Is this the third degree?
I'm trying to figure out when I get to see you again.
I'm not dating anyone else.
I'm not planning on dating anyone else.
 I just want to see you.  I see.
Exclusively.
I got it.
That's very sweet. I just hadn't thought about things that way.
 So, think about it.  oK.
Because I think if we really want to see if it can work between us,
this time we got to make the commitment to be exclusive.
oK. I hear you.
oK.
The truth was, there were no other candidates in sight.
But Miranda wasn't ready to let Steve win by default.
You're dating a politician and you're not even registered to vote.
 It's the undecideds they're after.  He's goodlooking, he's got power...
It's got to be a turnon.
Yeah, I'm dating a potential comptroller. It's hot.
 I want to help out.  You're not interested in politics?
It's a great way to meet men.
With carrie, we can meet the inner circle and the interesting donors.
By interesting men she means single and rich.
 Guys, he's not running for president.  I'd vote for him. He's cute.
 So?  I always vote according to looks.
I base my decision on the swimsuit competition.
The country runs better with a goodlooking man in charge
Look at Nixon. No one wanted to fuck him, so he fucked everyone.
 I had a crush on Dan Quayle.  We need a president in a hat.
No one wears a hat anymore. FDR, good president, wore a hat.
So busy picking a hat, he forgot to get in the war.
 I had a crush on Dan Quayle.  We tried to ignore that the first time.
It was his crisp, white shirts.
 Reminded me of my father.  So, you were voting for your father.
There was something homoerotic about Quayle and Bush.
 very Batman and Robin.  Based strictly on looks,
 no one was cuter than JFK.  or quicker to jump in the sack.
I'm glad you three weren't around during the original 13 colonies.
I don't think our founding fathers were very fuckable.
I heard that Thomas Jefferson was a real fox.
There we were. Just four girls talking politics.
Meanwhile, Miranda was facing a day at the polls earlier than she expected.
Last night as we were walking home, Steve asked me to go steady.
How sweet. They still call it that?
I don't know if I can make that commitment.
How many other guys are you dating?
That's not the point. I'm so ambivalent about Steve and moving forward.
You did let him back in your life. There must be something there.
There's plenty there. Flaws that make me not want to stick my neck out.
But there's great stuff too.
Maybe I should be honest and tell him what I really feel which is..
what if somebody better comes along?
You gotta put a better spin on it than that.
You see... that's my problem.
I don't know how to be political in relationships.
It's time for the list. Things you like about him. Things you don't like.
 See which is longer.  That's so judgmental.
You are judgmental. Put it to good use.
oK, fine. I'll make a list.
Politics were always as relevant to me as a new Erica Jong novel.
But I did find it interesting that a discussion about politics
ultimately became a discussion about sex.
And a discussion about sex became a question of politics.
Which led me to wonder, if the two were inextricably linked, and if so...
can there be sex without politics?
That night, Samantha discovered her own hot, new candidate.
Hey, Pink Lady. can I buy that for you?
Maybe, if you promise never to use a lame line like that again.
It worked didn't it? Jeff Fenton.
Samantha Jones.
You are damn attractive. And that is not a line.
How long have you been sitting here?
 My first drink.  So, you're just naturally forward?
I'm aggressive. I run a successful hedge fund.
My life is about calculating risks.
Telling a beautiful lady she's attractive is the safest bet I've made all day.
Thank you.
 You like to ski?  I love it.
We have a house in Sun valley. How long have you been skiing?
 on and off for years.  I can tell. You've got the legs for it.
Got to run back to the office.
How about dinner this week?
I told you all about me but I didn't hear about you.
Samantha never felt better. There were gorgeous women
sitting on either side and Jeff had elected her.
Fenton Partners.
That's right. We're up 3200%0 for the year.
Samantha Jones. Public Relations. very nice.
You must do well. Who's gonna say no to you?
 What about dinner? Friday night?  I think that might work.
Just as her selfesteem was soaring right off the charts...
Nice to meet you, Pink Lady. I'll give you a call.
Bye.
Later that week,
I brought "the single ladies coalition to elect Bill Kelley" to a fundraiser.
What is the height difference between a short person and a little person?
 A little person?  A midget.
 A midget or a dwarf?  What's the difference?
Little person is the proper way to refer to an adult under 5 feet.
I agreed to go on a date with a very short person.
I didn't realize he was so short.
Sitting down he was proportional. Standing, he barely clears my nipples.
That may be the perfect height.
I can't cancel just because he's a munchkin.
This is a politically incorrect conversation for a political fundraiser.
Less than five feet is unacceptable.
I have to go mingle. There are a lot of cute guys here
and these things never last beyond two martinis.
charlotte was running her own campaign.
She wanted to be elected wife before the year was out.
 There's Miranda.  Give me that.
Hey, you made it.
Tell me, why are we voting for this guy?
He wants an investigation into the Board of Education for waste,
and he's against large corporations wasting your tax dollars.
 I'm sleeping with him.  Good enough for me.
come on, I'll introduce you.
Jesus christ, he talks more than I do.
This is the lovely Miranda Hobbes. And her friend Steve Brady.
 Hi.  I've heard great things about you.
You must be reading my clippings. I pay people a lot to say nice things.
If you win, maybe you can fix a couple of parking tickets.
I owe New York city $500. I figured I need the money more than they do.
It's a joke! come on, he knows I'm kidding.
 I'll get us a drink. Nice meeting you.  Nice meeting you.
Excuse me.
The dumb jokes. con.
cute butt... pro.
I don't believe in the Republican Party or Democratic Party.
I just believe in parties.
charlotte was stumping for her cause, and making newfriends.
I love Liechtenstein. But I loved comic books as a kid.
But that's great. His work is accessible on so many levels.
Sweetheart, this is charlotte. She runs a gallery downtown.
charlotte, this is my fiancee catherine.
 Hi.  Nice to meet you.
 Stanford!  Hi.
I can only stay a few minutes, I have tickets to the "vagina Monologues".
Why?
I don't eat at the restaurant, but I can still hear the specials.
 carrie, give me a sip of your drink.  This is my friend, Stanford Blatch.
 Bill Kelley.  I represent the queer vote.
If you can carry chelsea, you've got the city locked up.
I'm not worried about chelsea. Have you seen my ass?
Got my vote.
 12 o'clock.  Excuse me.
 Who's that guy?  That's his campaign manager.
 Fix me up.  How do you even know he's gay?
I've seen him rollerblading on 8th Avenue.
That's enough.
Please?
Great, now I'm a first lady and a pimp.
Hey, excuse me.
This is awkward, so feel free to stop me at any time, but...
there's a person here who would like to meet you.
 oK.  A guy.
Keep going.
It's the guy right over there.
You mean the blonde guy with the great arms.
Actually, no. It's the bald guy, with the great sense of humor.
 Do you knowthe blonde guy?  No.
 He's really much more my type.  oK.
Well... Go Kelley.
I wondered howto handle this political hot potato.
 He's not gay.  I could have sworn he was.
I realized I was getting good at politics.
I'm just so at the place where I'm ready to settle down.
It seems like a miracle when two nice people like you can find each other.
We met in the most unusual way.
one of my girlfriends threw a party
where all the women brought a man they weren't interested in.
 Somebody brought Bob.  The rest is history.
I love that!
one woman's trash is another woman's treasure.
Bill raised $6,000 that night.
It really got him in the mood.
You know, you're the first woman in ages I've felt this intimate with.
You're so beautiful. So funny... you're great.
Thank you.
I love making love to you.
The feeling is mutual.
Is there anything you want or need that I'm not doing?
 No, it's great.  'cause I want to know.
 I want to make you happy.  I am happy.
What about you? Is there anything you want or need that I'm not doing?
No.
 Well... maybe one thing.  What?
Well, I would love to get you in the shower.
Get each other all fresh and clean.
That sounds nice.
And then... I'd like you to pee on me.
I would be worried. The pee could be foreplay.
 My God!  Where there's smoke.
It's typical of men in power. They love to be dominated. Humiliated.
What did you say?
I told him I'd just gone, maybe another time.
I can't keep saying that forever.
I peed on a guy once during sex, but it was an accident.
 What did he say?  I don't think he noticed.
I once had to stop eating meat for six months.
So this is what it's come down to... ready, set, pee?
Sometimes with the right guy you have to make concessions.
 There's always gonna be something.  Are you advocating that I do this?
Why not? He's a greatlooking political prince.
Sure, it's practically a fairytale.. "The Princess And The Pee".
If you can't work it out with Bill, bring him to my party on Friday.
Everyone is bringing a guy they're no longer interested in.
That's a great idea, I can bring my short guy.
You're dating a munchkin and I'm following the yellow brick road.
A couple of nights later, and no closer to a solution, I had a date with Bill.
We went to his favorite Indian restaurant,
that boasted the hottest curry in the city.
So I just got some new polls.
I'm ahead in Manhattan and Brooklyn but I'm lagging in the Bronx.
I may have to spend another $15,000 to buy myself some voter turnout.
Pretty hot, isn't it? Have some water.
No, I'm fine.
Excuse me, can I get another one? You want a beer?
So, I read your column yesterday.
 You did?  It's great. very funny.
Just one question. Who's the handsome politico you refer to?
He's just some other fellow I'm seeing in Washington.
 You don't mind, do you?  My life is an open book. It has to be.
What I love about the column is the way you feel about it.
It's mutual. Even if I can't put it in print like you.
I am so crazy about you.
Me too.
I was hoping we could spend the night together
but I have an early meeting with the Brooklyn...
That's no problem.
Rain check?
That Friday night, charlotte threw her "used date party".
Hi, you made it!
There are so many eligible men here.
Hi charlotte, nice apartment. can I get you something to drink?
Yes, immediately, if not sooner.
You brought Stanford?
You said to bring a man you're not interested in.
You're making a mockery of this party.
 carrie, charlotte!  Hi!
 This is Jeff Fenton.  Ladies.
 How do you do?  It's a pleasure.
 I'll take your coat.  Take your time.
Mingle.
Is he the smallest man you've ever seen?
If you'll excuse me I have to meet my eligible guests.
I've got to get busy too.
 carrie!  Hey, what are you doing here?
I figured, before I finalize the list, I should see what's out there.
 How's that list going?  Great, fine.
I'm guessing that's Samantha's little friend.
You gotta go to cuba now. Another year will be too late.
can't you get arrested for going?
Fly through canada. They love Americans.
 I'll email you some of my pictures.  I'd love to see them.
 charlotte, right?  Right, and...
 Greg Miller.  very nice to meet you, Greg Miller.
 Having any luck?  Excuse me?
 Meeting someone.  I'm already here with somebody.
Yeah, an ex girlfriend, right?
What are you talking about?
Get a clue.
 You brought me here to dump me?  Not exactly.
I thought, maybe you could meet someone your own size.
Sweetheart, give me an hour in bed, you'll swear I'm the Jolly Green Giant.
 Really?  I'm the best you've ever had.
She felt so politically incorrect about dumping a man for his height.
She felt she had to sleep with him.
Fine. Let's go.
oK, I'm ready to go. There's nobody here for us.
Speak for yourself.
If these guys are in their thirties and these women don't want them,
there might just be a little something for me.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Hi.
I'm an adventure travel junkie. I took the year off after business school.
Trekked the old spice trail in Asia.
Talking to Greg, charlotte felt like she had unearthed a rare coin
that some other woman had discarded.
This is my ex, Belinda Peters, she hooked me up on this thing.
You must be a friend of Karen's. Thanks for bringing this great man.
You're welcome. can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure. Excuse me.
Bye. Thanks for coming.
once Melinda saw Greg talking to another woman,
he suddenly looked all shiny and new again.
That night, Jeff proved to Samantha
that he more than made up for his shortcomings.
Samantha told us later it was like having sex with a horny smurf.
Meanwhile, across town, Steve was busy stuffing Miranda's ballot box.
You know, I'm not looking for a quick answer in the monogamy thing.
It's probably something that's got to happen on its own.
It's just that I wanted you to know how I feel.
You're the best woman I've ever met.
I want you to know... to know that.
I love you, Miranda. I really do.
Steve had just said the one big pro that outweighed all the cons.
Later that week, Samantha put her heels away and gave Jeff a chance.
Little boy's room. I'll be right back.
Samantha was stunned.
It was one thing to date a man who went to the little boy's room.
Another to date one who still shopped at the little boy's department.
Samantha!
I'm not feeling very well. I've got to go. Goodnight.
Wait, I'll take you.
I'm not really sick. Look, Jeff...
I can't do this. It's not a good idea. I don't want to lead you on.
Lead me on? You came five times the other night.
 It's not really that...  Then, what?
What happened in the past five minutes?
 You shop at the boy's department.  So, what?
The clothes fit me better, plus they're cheaper.
Where do you shop, the big and tall whore store?
You're nothing but a big dick with a little man attached.
You're nothing but a big pair of tits, with too much extra leg room.
Surprisingly, Samantha had found what she was really looking for.
And it had nothing to do with size.
Somebody get me a booster chair.
She'd found a man who made her laugh. They dated for two weeks.
Though he was short, it was a long relationship for Samantha.
That night, parched and nervous, I spent another night with Bill.
 Man, that was great.  Yes, it was.
come on, let's take a shower.
come on, get in while it's hot.
 can I talk to you about something?  oK.
I've been giving this peeing thing a lot of thought,
and while I think it's totally fine that that's what you're into, I just...
It's just never really been my thing.
oh, yeah?
Yeah, so I thought instead, maybe you could close your eyes
and I could dribble warm tea on you. That might feel good.
or... maybe...
...you might think it's fun
to hear the sound of running water when we have sex.
And, if things got really serious between us, I could...
maybe, even, leave the bathroom door open sometime.
Although, I'm really not sure how comfortable I'd be with that either.
You know, there's something I want to tell you too.
Some people connected with the campaign read your column...
and they had a different take on it.
 What does that mean?  They said it was funny and clever,
but that it was a lot about sex.
They don't think I should date a sex columnist before the election.
They thought it was kind of seamy.
Wait a second, I may write about sex, but you like people to pee on you.
Yeah, but nobody knows about that.
I realized that politics had entered my bedroom as well as my bathroom.
I decided that my bravest political act would be to tell the truth.
I didn't use his real name. It was much more political not to.
